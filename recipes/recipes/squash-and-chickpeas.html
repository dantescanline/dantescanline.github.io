<p>This is an ottolenghi one, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/nov/12/squash-pumpkin-recipes-yotam-ottolenghi-gnocchi-braised-mash-butternut-coquina-queen">found here originally</a></p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<li>1 large squash, peeled and cut into 4cm dice (800g)</li>
<li>400g tinned cooked chickpeas, drained and rinsed</li>
<li>2-3 shallots, peeled and chopped</li>
<li>1 sweet pepper (or any thinly chopped vegetable that seems nice as filler)</li>
<li>1 garlic clove, peeled and thinly sliced</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>500ml vegetable stock</li>
<li>1 tsp cumin</li>
<li>1 tsp cardamom</li>
<li>1 tsp coriander</li>
<li>chili flakes or spicey thing</li>
<li>lots of black pepper</li>
<li>1/2 a lemon juice</li>
</ul>
<h2>Topping</h2>
<ul>
<li>10g chopped cilantro</li>
<li>150g Greek yoghurt</li>
</ul>
<h3>Extra stuff if you have it</h3>
<ul>
<li>2 tbsp harissa paste</li>
<li>1 tsp rose water</li>
</ul>
<h2>Directions</h2>
<p><strong>Preheat oven to 220c</strong></p>
<p>Cook the onions and aromatics down a bit in a big saucepan, then add the stock and cubed squash and let it simmer covered until its mostly cooked.</p>
<p>Transfer the squash cubes to a bowl without any liquid, coat them in oil and salt and pepper and then roast them in the oven, for aobut 20 mins or until nice.</p>
<p>Meanwhile dump the chickpeas back into the liquid and cook for another 10-20 minutes. Let the sauce thicken a little bit and you can smash up some of the chickpeas to help.</p>
<p>Once both parts are cooked to your liking put them together and dress with yogurt and cilantro.</p>
