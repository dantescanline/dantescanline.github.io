      <p>Samuel Edward Konkin III was a libertarian writer most famous for his Agorist idea of a purely market society,
        and his brand of activism which he called counter-economics. His name and philosophy come up a lot in left
        market circles because of his extreme free market views and his use of the term 'left' to describe himself,
        though as always left is an extremely nebulous term. He does at least reject the term 'capitalism' in part,
        agreeing with the long standing historical use that it means an economy where a few capitalists heavily
        determine the possibilities for the rest. Though as a classic libertarian he defends profit (wage labor) and
        some rents.</p>

      <p>Konkin starts the primer with a quick tour through some Austrian school economics focusing on subjective value,
        marginal utility and mediums of exchange. He explains marginal utility quite well with an example of shepherds
        trading sheep and a valuable coat. In his example a coat can be made from one sheep, so a shepard with one coat
        and ten sheep is unlikely to trade their coat for another sheep. They'd be right back where they started except
        they would have to perform the labor of convering the new sheep back into a coat. A richer shepard with twenty
        sheep and no coat would be quite happy to give up two or more sheep for the coat, and likewise the first shepard
        would be ahead now with an extra sheep left over after converting one into a coat. I find these little seeds of
        economics sorely missing from much of the writing in the LWMA discourse. We don't need a deep dive on these
        terms to get the point across that markets can have broadly distributivist and egalitarian outcomes.</p>

      <p>Konkin's greatest strength in this primer is his sober view of the realites of existing statist market
        societies. Illegal trade and law avoidence in general already makes up a huge chunk of the economic activity
        that everyday people engage in. This is one of the best pieces of evidence we have as pro-market radicals in
        criticizing the business as usual of capitalism and police. If people are already able to band together and run
        underground networks of exchange or simply agree to deal outside of the state wherever enforcement is lax
        enough, then what exactly is the benefit of policing on the population? Konkin highlights this well in talking
        about the absurdity of price regulation:</p>

      <p>&quot;If all the regulations passed in any country you wish to name were completely obeyed, let alone enforced,
        we would all be dead. Consider a particularly pathological case in the United States of America. If you charge a
        price for your product higher than your competitors, this is taken as evidence under the Sherman Anti-Trust Act
        that you have a monopoly and charges may be brought against you. The same problem arises if you charge the same;
        that is considered evidence of a cartel and you and your competitors can all be fined. Finally, if you charge
        less than your competitors, you are violating the &ldquo;Fair Trade&rdquo; laws in most states and can be
        arrested and fined. It is impossible to obey all the regulations.&quot;</p>

      <p>Though the primer is too short to dive into the history of trade regulation in the USA, the freed market
        anti-capitalist case here is very strong. Even given the benefit of the doubt, ernest attempts at balancing out
        monopolies has almost always led to increased power for encumbants. At worst, these are overt protectionist
        deals knowingly created to protect specific firms or industries.</p>

      <p>Konkin's explanation of counter-economics is simple: do what you would do normally but outside the purview of
        the state. This includes tax evasion, black market exchanges, and settling disputes through private means
        totally avoiding state police.</p>

      <p>&quot;The State&rsquo;s imposition of some people&rsquo;s moral codes on others leads to Bible smuggling in
        atheist States and pornography publishing in conserva- tive religious States. The &ldquo;world&rsquo;s oldest
        profession,&rdquo; as sexual prostitution has been titled, is also &mdash; if that title is true &mdash; the
        world&rsquo;s oldest counter-economic industry. Feminists seeking control of their own bodies look to the
        Counter-Economy to obtain contracep- tives and find midwives to deliver babies their way in the Counter-Economy.
        Nobody works at anything anywhere which is not connected with Counter-Economics.&quot;</p>

      <p>One of the better insights of the primer is that you can do some simple calculations about the risks in evading
        state enforcement, just like any other business calculation. Looking at punishment in the form of fines and the
        probability of acquittal with help of a paid lawyer, you can compare this to the potential profit if gotten away
        with. While this is considerably more difficult with less business-styled endeavours like mutual aid, it's still
        a pretty powerful tool for thinking about radical action. This is also very much in line with Konkin's
        philosophy in general, that belief without radical action is pointless and disconnected from reality. Konkin was
        very much a </p>
