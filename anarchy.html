  To outsiders the simplest description of anarchists is usually that they oppose government. This is true! But secretly
  the oppose something deeper, of which government is simply the most obvious branch: Power, domination, hierarchy,
  oppression. All these things exist as an inherent part of state society, and they exist also in the more commonly
  opposed and named racisms, ableisms, transphobias that people are familiar with.


  “To make a thief, make an owner; to create crime, create laws.”

  “A revolution on a world scale will take a very long time. But it is also possible to recognize that it is already
  starting to happen. The easiest way to get our minds around it is to stop thinking about revolution as a thing — “the”
  revolution, the great cataclysmic break—and instead ask “what is revolutionary action?” We could then
  suggest: revolutionary action is any collective action which rejects, and therefore confronts, some form of power or
  domination and in doing so, reconstitutes social relations—even within the collectivity—in that light. Revolutionary
  action does not necessarily have to aim to topple governments. Attempts to create autonomous communities in the face
  of power (using Castoriadis' definition
  here: ones that constitute themselves, collectively make their own rules or principles of operation, and continually
  reexamine them), would, for
  instance, be almost by definition revolutionary acts. And history shows us that the continual accumulation
  of such acts can change (almost) everything.” Graeber

  But how are people supposed to be able to organize without government, and without the economy supported so carefully
  by government? It doesn't take more than a minute of thinking to realize the average working person actually does the
  work, and that the 'economy' as a construction is largely about interrupting those mutually agreed upon resource.

  Remember the Great Depression of the Thirties? One day there was a flourishing
  consumer economy, with everyone on the up‐and‐up; and the next: poverty, un‐
  employment and breadlines. What happened? The physical resources of the
  country—the brain, brawn, and raw materials—were in no way depleted, but
  there was a sudden absence of money, a so‐called financial slump. Complex rea‐
  sons for this kind of disaster can be elaborated at lengths by experts in banking
  and high finance who cannot see the forest for the trees. But it was just as if
  someone had come to work on building a house and, on the morning of the De‐
  pression, that boss had to say, “Sorry, baby, but we can’t build today. No inches.”
  “Whaddya mean, no inches? We got wood. We got metal. We even got tape
  measures.” “Yeah, but you don’t understand business. We been using too many
  inches, and there’s just no more to go around.” Karl Hess


  It’s very like a prison society or prison collective[244] (those who enjoy[245] the same prison). Here we get into a
  third factor even richer than the merely local one, the room, was. Prison no longer just means a space, but a space
  with express reference to its residents: it is indeed only a prison because it is intended for prisoners, without whom
  it would be a mere building. What gives a common stamp to the collectivity in it? Obviously, the prison, since they
  are prisoners only by means of the prison. So what determines the way of life of prison society? The prison! What
  determines their intercourse? Perhaps also the prison? Of course, they can only carry on intercourse as prisoners,
  i.e., only as far as prison laws allow it; but that they themselves hold intercourse, I with you, this the prison
  cannot bring about; on the contrary, it must take care to prevent such egoistic, purely personal intercourse (and only
  as such is it actual intercourse between you and me). That we collectively perform a task, operate a machine, set
  something in motion, a prison will provide well for this; but that I forget that I am a prisoner, and enter into
  intercourse with you who equally disregard it, that puts the prison at risk, and not only cannot be brought about by
  it, but furthermore must not be permitted. For this reason, the saintly and morally—minded French chamber decides to
  introduce solitary confinement, and other saints will do the same in order to cut off “demoralizing intercourse.”
  Imprisonment is the established and—sacred condition against which no attempt to injure is allowed. The slightest
  challenge of this sort is punishable, like any rebellion against a sacred thing by which the human being is supposed
  to be inhibited and imprisoned.


  Atro had once explained to him how this was managed, how the sergeants could give the privates orders, how the
  lieutenants could give the privates and the sergeants orders, how the captains ...and so on and so on up to the
  generals, who could give everyone else orders and need take them from none, except the commander in chief. Shevek had
  listened with incredulous disgust “You call that organization?” he had inquired. “You even call it discipline? But it
  is neither. It is a coercive mechanism of extraordinary inefficiency — a kind of seventh-millennium steam engine! With
  such a rigid and fragile structure what could be done that was worth doing?” This had given Atro a chance to argue the
  worth of warfare as the breeder of courage and manliness and the weeder-out of the unfit, but the very line of his
  argument had forced him to concede the effectiveness of guerillas, organized from below, self-disciplined, “But that
  only works when the people think they're fighting for something of their own — you know, their homes, or some notion
  or other,” the old man had said. Shevek had dropped the argument He now continued it, in the darkening basement among
  the stacked crates of unlabeled chemicals. He explained to Atro that he now understood why the army was organized as
  it was. It was indeed quite necessary. No rational form of organization would serve the purpose. He simply had not
  understood that the purpose was to enable men with machine guns to kill unarmed men and women easily and in great
  quantities when told to do so. Only he still could not see where courage, or manliness, or fitness entered in.
