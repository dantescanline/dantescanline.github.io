    <h1>Mimsy Were the Borogoves</h1>
    <p>By Lewis Padgett (a pseudonym of American writers Henry Kuttner and C. L. Moore)</p>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There's no use trying to
    describe either Unthahorsten or his surroundings, because, for one thing, a good many million years had passed since
    1942 Anno Domini and, for another, Unthahorsten wasn't on Earth, technically speaking. He was doing the equivalent
    of standing in the equivalent of a laboratory. He was preparing to test his time machine.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Having turned on the power, Unthahorsten suddenly realized
    that the Box was empty. Which wouldn't do at all. The device needed a control, a three-dimensional solid which would
    react to the conditions of another age. Otherwise Unthahorsten couldn't tell, on the machine's return, where and
    when it had been. Whereas a solid in the Box would automatically be subject to the entropy and cosmic ray
    bombardment of the other era, and Unthahorsten could measure the changes, both qualitative and quantitative, when
    the machine returned. The Calculators could then get to work and, presently, tell Unthahorsten that the Box had
    briefly visited 1,000,000 A.D., 1,000 A.D., or 1 A.D., as the case might be.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not that it mattered, except to Unthahorsten. But he was
    childish in many respects.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There was little time to
    waste. The Box was beginning to glow and shiver. Unthahorsten stared around wildly, fled into the next gossatch, and
    groped in a storage bin there. He came up with an armful of peculiar-looking stuff. Uh-huh. Some of the discarded
    toys of his son Snowen, which the boy had brought with him when he had passed over from Earth, after mastering the
    necessary technique. Well, Snowen needed this junk no longer. He was conditioned, and put away childish things.
    Besides, though Unthahorsten's wife kept the toys for sentimental reasons, the experiment was more important.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unthahorsten left the glossatch and dumped the assortment
    into the Box, slamming the cover shut just before the warning signal flashed. The Box went away. The manner of its
    departure hurt Unthahorsten's eyes.<br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He waited.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And he waited.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Eventually he gave up and built another time machine, with
    identical results. Snowen hadn't been annoyed by the loss of his old toys, nor had Snowen's mother, so Unthahorsten
    cleaned out the bin and dumped the remainder of his son's childhood relics in the second time machine's Box.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to his calculations, this one should have appeared
    on Earth, in the latter part of the nineteenth century, A.D. If that actually occurred, the device remained
    there.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Disgusted, Unthahorsten decided to make no more
    time machines. But the mischief had been done. There two of them, and the first-<br><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Scott Paradine found it while he was playing hooky from the
    Glendale Grammar School. There was a geography test that day, and Scott saw no sense in memorizing place names -
    which in 1942 was a fairly sensible theory. Besides, it was the sort of warm spring day, with a touch of coolness in
    the breeze, which invited a boy to lie down in a field and stare at the occasional clouds till he fell asleep. Nuts
    to geography! Scott dozed.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; About noon he got hungry, so
    his stocky legs carried him to a nearby store. There he invested his small hoard with penurious care and a sublime
    disregard for his gastric juices. He went down by the creek to feed.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Having finished his supply of cheese, chocolate, and cookies,
    and having drained the soda-pop bottle to its dregs, Scott caught tadpoles and studied them with a certain amount of
    scientific curiosity. He did not persevere. Something tumbled down the bank, and thudded into the muddy ground near
    the water, so Scott, with a wary glance around, hurried to investigate.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was a Box. It was, in fact, the Box. The gadgetry hitched
    to it meant little to Scott, though he wondered why it was so fused and burnt. He pondered. With his jackknife he
    pried and probed, his tongue sticking out from a corner of his mouth - Hm-m-m. Nobody was around. Where had the box
    come from? Somebody must have left it here, and sliding soil had dislodged it from its precarious perch.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's a helix," Scott decided, quite erroneously. It was
    helical, but it wasn't a helix, because of the dimensional warp involved. Had the thing been a model airplane, no
    matter how complicated, it would have held few mysteries to Scott. As it was, a problem was posed. Something told
    Scott that the device was a lot more complicated than the spring motor he had deftly dismantled last Friday.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But no boy has ever left a box unopened, unless forcibly
    dragged away. Scott probed deeper. The angles on this thing were funny. Short circuit, probably. That was why - uh!
    The knife snapped. Scott sucked his thumb and gave vent to experienced blasphemy.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Maybe it was a music box.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Scott shouldn't have felt depressed. The gadgetry would have
    given Einstein a headache and driven Steinmetz raving mad. The trouble was, of course, that the box had not yet
    completely entered the space-time continuum where Scott exited and therefore it could not be opened. At any rate,
    not till Scott used a convenient rock to hammer the helical nonhelix into a more convenient position.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He hammered it, in fact, from its contact point with the
    fourth dimension, releasing the space0time torsion it had been maintaining. There was a brittle snap. the box jarred
    slightly, and lay motionless, no longer only partially in existence. Scott opened it easily now.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The soft, woven helmet was the first thing that caught his
    eye, but he discarded that without much interest. It was just a cap. Next he lifted a square, transparent crystal
    block, small enough to cup in his palm - much too small to contain the maze of apparatus within it. In a moment
    Scott had solved that problem. The crystal was a sort of magnifying glass, vastly enlarging the things inside the
    block. Strange things they were, too. Miniature people, for example-<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They moved. Like clockwork automatons, though much more
    smoothly. It was rather like watching a play. Scott was interested in their costumes, but fascinated by their
    actions. The tiny people were deftly building a house. Scott wished it would catch fire, so he could see the people
    put it out.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Flames licked up from the half-completed
    structure. The automatons, with a great deal of odd apparatus, extinguished the blaze.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It didn't take Scott long to catch on. But he was a little
    worried. The manikins would obey his thoughts. By the time he discovered that, he was frightened, and threw the cube
    from him.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Halfway up the bank, he reconsidered and
    returned. The crystal block lay partly in the water, shining in the sun. It was a toy; Scott sensed that, with the
    unerring instinct of a child. But he didn't pick it up immediately. Instead, he returned to the box and investigated
    its remaining contents.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He found some really remarkable
    gadgets. The afternoon passed all too quickly, Scott finally put the toys back in the box and lugged it home,
    grunting and puffing. He was quite red-faced by the time he arrived at the kitchen door.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His find he hid at the back of the closet in his own room
    upstairs. The crystal cube he slipped into his pocket, which already bulged with string, a coil of wire, two
    pennies, a wad of tinfoil, a grimy defenses stamp, and a chunk of feldspar. Emma, Scott's two-year-old sister,
    waddled unsteadily in from the hall and said hello.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    "Hello, Slug," Scott nodded, from his altitude of seven years and some months. He patronized Emma shockingly, but
    she didn't know the difference. Small, plump, and wide-eyed, she flopped down on the carpet and stared dolefully at
    her shoes.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Tie 'em, Scotty, please?"<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sap," Scott told her kindly, but knotted the laces. "Dinner
    ready yet?"<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Emma nodded.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let's see your hands." For a wonder, they were reasonably
    clean, though probably not aseptic. Scott regarded his own paws thoughtfully and, grimacing, went to the bathroom,
    where he made a sketchy toilet. The tadpoles had left their traces.<br><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dennis Paradine and his wife Jane were having a cocktail
    before dinner, downstairs in the living room. He was a youngish, middle-aged man with gray-shot hair and a thinnish,
    prim-mouthed face; he taught philosophy at the university. Jane was small, neat, dark, and very pretty. She sipped
    her Martini and said<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "New shoes. Like 'em?"<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Here's to crime," Paradine muttered absently. "Huh? Shoes?
    Not now. Wait till I've finished this. I had a bad day."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    "Exams?"<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yeah. Flaming youths aspiring toward manhood. I
    hope they die. In considerable agony. Insh'Allah!"<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I
    want the olive," Jane requested.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I know," Paradine said
    despondently. "It's been years since I've tasted one myself. In a Martini, I mean. Even if I put six of 'em in your
    glass, you're still not satisfied."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I want yours. Blood
    brotherhood. Symbolism. That's why."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Paradine regarded
    his wife balefully and crossed his long legs. "You sound like one of my students."<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Like that hussy Betty Dawson, perhaps?" Jane unsheathed her
    nails. "Does she still leer at you in that offensive way?"<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "She does. The child is a neat psychological problem. Luckily
    she isn't mine. If she were-" Paradine nodded significantly. "Sex consciousness and too many movies. I suppose she
    still thinks she can get a passing grade by showing me her knees. Which are, by the way, rather bony."<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jane adjusted her skirt with an air of complacent pride.
    Paradine uncoiled himself and poured fresh Martinis. "Candidly, I don't see the point of teaching those apes
    philosophy. They're all at the wrong age. Their habit-patterns, their methods of thinking, are already laid down.
    They're horribly conservative, not that they'd admit it. The only people who can understand philosophy are mature
    adults or kids like Emma and Scotty."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, don't enroll
    Scotty in your course," Jane requested. "He isn't ready for Philosophiae Doctor. I hold no brief for child geniuses,
    especially when it's my child"<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Scotty would probably be
    better at it than Betty Dawson," Paradine grunted.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "'He
    died an enfeebled dotard at five,'" Jane quoted dreamily. "I want your olive."<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Here. By the way, I like the shoes."<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Thank you. Here's Rosalie. Dinner?"<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's all ready, Miz Pa'dine," said Rosalie, hovering. "I'll
    call Miss Emma 'n' Mista' Scotty."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I'll get
    'em."Paradine put his head into the next room and roared, "Kids! Come and get it!"<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Small feet scuttered down the stairs. Scott dashed into the
    view, scrubbed and shining, a rebellious cowlick aimed at the zenith. Emma pursued, levering herself carefully down
    the steps. Halfway she gave up the attempt to descend upright and reversed, finishing the task monkey-fashion, her
    small behind giving an impression of marvelous diligence upon the work in hand. Paradine watched, fascinated by the
    spectacle, till he was hurled back by the impact of his son's body.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hi, dad!" Scott shrieked.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Paradine recovered himself and regarded Scott with dignity.
    "Hi, yourself. Help me in to dinner. You've dislocated at least one of my hip joints."<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But Scott was already tearing into the next room, where he
    stepped on Jane's new shoes in an ecstasy of affection, burbled an apology, and rushed off to find his place at the
    dinner table. Paradine cocked up an eyebrow as he followed, Emma's pudgy hand desperately gripping his
    forefinger.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Wonder what the young devil's been up
    to?"<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No good, probably," Jane sighed. "Hello, darling.
    Let's see your ears."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "They're clean. Mickey licked
    'em."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, that Airedale's tongue is far cleaner than
    your ears," Jane pondered, making a brief examination. "Still, as long as you can hear, the dirt's only
    superficial."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Fisshul?"<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Just a little, that means," Jane dragged her daughter to the
    table and inserted her legs into a high chair. Only had Emma graduated to the dignity of dining with the rest of the
    family, and she was, as Paradine remarked, all eat up with pride by the prospect. Only babies spilled food, Emma had
    been told. As a result, she took such painstaking care in conveying her spoon to her mouth that Paradine got the
    jitters whenever he watched.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "A conveyer belt would be
    the thing for Emma," he suggested, pulling out a chair for Jane. "Small buckets of spinach arriving at her face at
    stated intervals."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dinner proceeded uneventfully until
    Paradine happened to glance at Scott's plate. "Hello, there. Sick? Been stuffing yourself at lunch?"<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Scott thoughtfully examined the food still left before him.
    "I've had all I need, dad," he explained.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You usually
    eat all you can hold, and a great deal more," Paradine said. "I know growing boys need several tons of foodstuffs a
    day, but you're below par tonight. Feel OK?"<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Uh-huh.
    Honest, I've had all I need."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "All you want?"<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sure. I eat different."<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Something they taught you at school?" Jane inquired.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Scott shook his head solemnly.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Nobody taught me. I found it out myself. I used spit."<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Try again," Paradine suggested. "It's the wrong word."<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    "Uh&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; s-saliva. Hm-m-m?"<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Uh-huh. More pepsin? Is there pepsin in the salivary juices,
    Jane? I forget."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There's poison in mine," Jane remarked.
    "Rosalie's left lumps in the mashed potatoes again."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But
    Paradine was interested. "You mean you're getting everything possible out of you food - no wastage - and eating
    less?"<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Scott thought that over. "I guess so. It's not
    just the sp&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; saliva. I sort of measure how much to put in
    my mouth at once, and what stuff to mix up. I dunno. I just do it."<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hm-m-m," said Paradine, making a note to check up later.
    "Rather a revolutionary idea." Kids often get screwy notions, but this one might not be so far off the beam. He
    pursed his lips. "Eventually I suppose people will eat quit differently - I mean the way they eat, as well as what.
    What they eat, I mean. Jane, our son shows signs of becoming a genius."<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh?"<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's a rather good point in dietetics he just made. Did you
    figure it out for yourself, Scott?"<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sure," the boy said,
    and really believed it.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where'd you get the idea?"<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, I-" Scott wriggled. "I dunno. It doesn't mean much, I
    guess."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Paradine was unreasonable disappointed. "But
    surely-"<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "S-s-s-spit!" Emma shrieked, overcome by a
    sudden fit of badness. "Spit!" she attempted to demonstrate, but succeeded only in dribbling into her bib.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With a resigned air Jane rescued and reproved her daughter,
    while Paradine eyed SCott with rather puzzled interest. But it was not till after dinner, in the living room, that
    anything further happened.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "any homework?"<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "N-no," Scott said, flushing guiltily. To cover his
    embarrassment he took from his pocket a gadget he had found in the box, and began to unfold it. The result resembled
    a tesseract, strung with beads. Paradine didn't see it at first, but Emma did. She wanted to play with it.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No. Lay off, Slug," Scott ordered. "You can watch me." He
    fumbled with the beads, making soft, interesting noises. Emma extended a fat forefinger and yelped.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Scotty," Paradine said warningly.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I didn't hurt her."<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Bit me. It did," Emma mourned.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Paradine looked up. He frowned, staring. What in-<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is that an abacus?" he asked. "Let's see it, please."<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Somewhat unwillingly Scott brought the gadget across to his
    father's chair. Paradine blinked. The "abacus," unfolded, was more than a foot square, composed of thing, rigid
    wires that interlocked here and there. On the wires colored beads were strung. They could be slid back and forth,
    and from one support to another, even at the points of juncture. But - a pierced bead couldn't cross interlocking
    wires&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, apparently, they weren't pierced. Paradine looked closer.
    Each small bead had a deep groove running around it, so that it could be revolved and slid along the wire at the
    same time. Paradine tried to pull one free. It clung as though magnetically. Iron? It looked more like plastic.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The framework itself - Paradine wasn't a mathematician. But
    the angles formed by the wires were vaguely shocking, in their ridiculous lack of Euclidean logic. They were a maze.
    Perhaps that's what the gadget was - a puzzle.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where'd
    you get this?"<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Uncle Harry gave it to me, "Scott said on
    the spur of the moment. "Last Sunday, when he came over." Uncle Harry was out of town, a circumstance Scott well
    knew. At the age of seven, a boy soon learns that the vagaries of adults follow a certain definite pattern, and that
    they are fussy about the donors of gifts. Moreover, Uncle Harry would not return for several weeks; the expiration
    of that period was unimaginable to Scott, or, at least, the fact that his lie would ultimately be discovered meant
    less to him than the advantages of being allowed to keep the toy.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Paradine found himself growing slightly confused as he
    attempted to manipulate the beads. The angles were vaguely illogical. It was like a puzzle. This red bead, if slid
    along this wire to that junction, should reach there&nbsp; but it didn't. A maze, odd, but no doubt instructive.
    Paradine had a well-founded feeling that he'd have no patience with the thing himself.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Scott did, however, retiring to a corner and sliding beads
    around with much fumbling and grunting. The beads did sting, when Scott chose the wrong ones or tried to slide them
    in the wrong direction. At last he crowed exultantly.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I
    did it, dad!"<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ""Eh? What? Let's see." The device looked
    exactly the same to Paradine, but Scott pointed and beamed.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I made it disappear."<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's still there."<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That blue bead. It's gone now."<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Paradine didn't believe that, so he merely snorted. Scott
    puzzled over the framework again. He experimented. This time there were no shocks, even slight. The abacus had
    showed him the correct method. Now it was up to him to do it on his own. The bizarre angles of the wires seemed a
    little less confusing now, somehow.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was a most
    instructive toy-<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It worked, Scott thought, rather like
    the crystal cube. Reminded of the gadget, he took it from his pocket and relinquished the abacus to Emma, who was
    struck dumb with joy. she fell to work sliding the beads, this time without protesting against the shocks&nbsp;
    which, indeed, were very minor&nbsp; and, being imitative, she managed to make a bead disappear almost as quickly as
    had Scott. The blue bead reappeared&nbsp; but Scott didn't notice. He had forethoughtfully retired into an angle of
    the chesterfield with an overstuffed chair and amused himself with the cube.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There were little people inside the thing, tiny manikins
    which enlarged by the magnifying properties of the crystal, and they moved, all right. They built a house. It caught
    fire, with realistic-seeming flames, and stood by waiting. Scott puffed urgently. "Put it out!"<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But nothing happened. Where was that queer fire engine, with
    revolving arms, that had appeared before? Here it was. It came sailing into the picture and stopped. Scott urged it
    on.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This was fun. Like putting on a play, only more real.
    The little people did what Scott told them, inside of his head. If he made a mistake, they waited till he'd found
    the right way. They even posed new problems for him-<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
    cube, too, was a most instructive toy. It was teaching Scott, with alarming rapidity&nbsp; and teaching him very
    entertainingly. But it gave him no really knowledge as yet. He wasn't ready. Later&nbsp; later <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Emma grew tired of the abacus and went in search of Scott.
    She couldn't find him, even in his room, but once there the contents of the closet intrigued her. She discovered the
    box. It contained a treasure-trove&nbsp; a doll, which Scott had already noticed but discarded with a sneer.
    Squealing, Emma brought the doll downstairs, squatted in the middle of the floor, and began to take it apart.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Darling! What's that?"<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Bear!"<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Obviously it wasn't Mr. Bear, who was blind, earless, but
    comforting in his own soft fatness. But all dolls were named Mr. Bear to Emma.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jane Paradine hesitated. "Did you take that from some other
    little girl?"<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I didn't. She's mine."<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Scott came out from his hiding place, thrusting the cube into
    his pocket. "Uh&nbsp; that's from Uncle Harry."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Did
    Uncle Harry give that to you, Emma?"<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He gave it to me
    for Emma," Scott put in hastily, adding another stone to his foundation of deceit. "Last Sunday."<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You'll break it, dear."<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Emma brought the doll to her mother. "She comes apart.
    See?"<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh?
    It&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ugh!" Jane sucked in her breath. Paradine looked up
    quickly.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's up?"<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She brought the doll over to him, hesitated, and then went
    into the dining room, giving Paradine a significant glance. He followed, closing the door. Jane had already placed
    the doll on the cleared table.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This isn't very nice, is
    it Denny?"<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hm-m-m." It was rather unpleasant, at first
    glance. One might have expected an anatomical dummy in a medical school, but a child's doll-<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The thing came apart in sections, skin, muscles, organs,
    miniature but quite perfect, as far as Paradine could see. He was interested. "Dunno. Such things haven't the same
    connotations to a kid-"<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Look at that liver. Is it a
    liver?"<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sure. Say
    I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; this is funny."<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What?"<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It isn't anatomically perfect, after all." Paradine pulled
    up a chair. "The digestive tract's too short. No large intestine. No appendix, either."<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Should Emma have a thing like this?"<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I wouldn't mind having it myself," Paradine said. "Where on
    earth did Harry pick it up? No, I don't see any harm in it. Adults are conditioned to react unpleasantly to innards.
    Kids don't. They figure they're solid inside, like a potato. Emma can get a sound working knowledge of physiology
    from this doll."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But what are those? Nerves?"<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, these are the nerves. Arteries here; veins here. Funny
    sort of aorta-" Paradine looked baffled. "That&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; what's
    Latin for network? Anyway&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; huh? Rita? Rata?"<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Rales," Jane suggested at random.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's a sort of breathing," Paradine said crushingly. "I
    can't figure out what this luminous network of stuff is. It goes all through the body, like nerves."<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Blood."<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Nope. Not circulatory, not neural&nbsp; funny! It seems to
    be hooked up with the lungs."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They became engrossed,
    puzzling over the strange doll. It was made with remarkable perfection of detail, and that in itself was strange, in
    view of the physiological variation from the norm. "Wait'll I get that Gould," Paradine said, and presently was
    comparing the doll with anatomical charts. He learned little, except to increase his bafflement.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But it was more fun than a jigsaw puzzle.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Meanwhile, in the adjoining room, Emma was sliding the beads
    to and fro in the abacus. The motions didn't seem so strange now. Even when the beads vanished. She could almost
    follow that new direction&nbsp; almost-<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Scott panted,
    staring into the crystal cube and mentally directing, with many false starts, the building of a structure somewhat
    more complicated than the one which had been destroyed by fire. He, too, was learning&nbsp; being
    conditioned-<br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Paradine's mistake, from a completely
    anthropomorphic standpoint, was that he didn't get rid of the toys instantly. He did not realize their significance,
    and, but the time he did, the progression of circumstances had got well under way. Uncle Harry remained out of town,
    so Paradine couldn't check with him. Too, the midterm exams were on, which meant arduous mental effort and complete
    exhaustion at night; and Jane was slightly ill for a week or so. Emma and Scott had free rein with the toys.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What," Scott asked his father one evening, "is a wabe,
    dad?"<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Wave?"<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He hesitated.
    "I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; don't think so. Isn't wabe right?"<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Wab is Scot for web. That it?"<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't see how," Scott muttered, and wandered off,
    scowling, to amuse himself with the abacus. He was able to handle it quite deftly now. But, with the instinct of
    children for avoiding interruptions, he and Emma usually played with the toys in private. Not obviously, of
    course&nbsp; but the more intricate experiments were never performed under the eye of an adult.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Scott was learning fast. What he now saw in the crystal cube
    had little relationship to the original simple problems. But they were fascinatingly technical. Had Scott realized
    that his education was being guided and supervised&nbsp; though merely mechanically&nbsp; he would probably have
    lost interest. As it was, his initiative was never quashed.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Abacus, cube, doll&nbsp; and other toys the children found in
    the box-<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Neither Paradine nor Jane guessed how much of an
    effect the contents of the time machine were having on the kids. How could they? Youngsters are instinctive
    dramatists, for purposes of self-protection. They have not yet fitted themselves to the exigencies&nbsp; to them
    partially inexplicable&nbsp; of a mature world. Moreover, their lives are complicated by human variables. They are
    told by one person that playing in the mud is permissible, but that, in their excavations, they must not uproot
    flowers or small trees. Another adult vetoes mud per se. The Ten Commandments are not carved on stone; they vary,
    and children are helplessly dependent on the caprice of those who give them birth and feed and clothe them. And
    tyrannize. The wound animal does not resent that benevolent tyranny, for it is an essential part of nature. He is,
    however, an individualist, and maintains his integrity by a subtle, passive fight.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the eyes of an adult he changes. Like an actor
    on-stage, when he remembers, he strives to please, and also to attract attention to himself. Such attempts are not
    unknown to maturity. But adults are less obvious&nbsp; to other adults.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is difficult to admit that children lack subtlety.
    Children are different from the mature animal because they think in another way. We can more or less easily pierce
    the pretenses they set up&nbsp; but they can do the same to us. Ruthlessly a child can destroy the pretenses of an
    adult. Iconoclasm is their prerogative.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Foppishness, for
    example. The amenities of social intercourse, exaggerated not quite to absurdity. The gigolo-<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Such savoir faire! Such punctilious courtesy!" The dowager
    and the blond young thing are often impressed. Men have less pleasant comments to make. But the child goes to the
    root of the matter.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You're silly!"<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How can an immature human understand the complicated system
    of social relationships? He can't. To him, an exaggeration of natural courtesy is silly. In his functional structure
    of life-patterns, it is rococo. He is an egotistic little animal, who cannot visualize himself in the position of
    another&nbsp; certainly not an adult. A self-contained, almost perfect natural unit, his wants supplied by others,
    the child is much like a unicellular creature floating in the blood stream, nutriment carried to him, waste products
    carried away-<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From the standpoint of logic, a child is
    rather horribly perfect. A baby may be even more perfect, but so alien to an adult that only superficial standards
    of comparison apply. The thought processes of an infant are completely unimaginable. But babies think, even before
    birth. In the womb they move and sleep, not entirely through instinct. We are conditioned to react rather peculiarly
    to the idea that a nearly-viable embryo may think. We are surprised, shocked into laughter, and repelled. Nothing
    human is alien.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But a baby is not human. An embryo is far
    less human.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That, perhaps, was why Emma learned more from
    the toys than did Scott. He could communicate his thoughts, of course; Emma could not, except in cryptic fragments.
    The matter of the scrawls, for example-<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Give a young
    child pencil and paper, and he will draw something which looks different to him than to an adult. The absurd
    scribbles have little resemblance to a fire engine, to a baby. Perhaps it is even three-dimensional. Babies think
    differently and see differently.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Paradine brooded over
    that, reading his paper one evening and watching Emma and Scott communicate. Scott was questioning his sister.
    Sometimes he did it in English. More often he had resource to gibberish and sign language. Emma tried to reply, but
    the handicap was too great.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally Scott got pencil and
    paper. Emma liked that. Tongue in cheek, she laboriously wrote a message. Scott took the paper, examined it, and
    scowled.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That isn't right, Emma," he said.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Emma nodded vigorously. She seized the pencil again and made
    more scrawls. Scott puzzled for a while, finally smiled rather hesitantly, and got up. He vanished into the hall.
    Emma returned to the abacus. Paradine rose and glanced down at the paper, with some mad thought that Emma might
    abruptly have mastered calligraphy. But she hadn't. The paper was covered with meaningless scrawls, of a type
    familiar to any parent. Paradine pursed his lips.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It
    might be a graph showing the mental variations of a manic-depressive cockroach, but probably wasn't. Still, it no
    doubt had meaning to Emma. Perhaps the scribble represented Mr. Bear.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Scott returned, looking pleased. He met Emma's gaze and
    nodded. Paradine felt a twinge of curiosity.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    "Secrets?"<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Nope.
    Emma&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    uh&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; asked me to do something for her."<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh." Paradine, recalling instance of babies who had babbled
    in unknown tongues and baffled linguists, made a note to pocket the paper when the kids had finished with it. The
    next day he showed the scrawl to Elkins at the university. Elkins had a sound working knowledge of many unlikely
    languages, but he chuckled over Emma's venture into literature.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Here's a free translation, Dennis. Quote. I don't know what
    this means, but I kid the hell out of my father with it. Unquote."<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The two men laughed and went off to their classes. But later
    Paradine was to remember the incident. Especially after he met Holloway. Before that, however, months were to pass,
    and the situation to develop even further toward its climax.<br> Aneirin<br> 09-08-2004, 0620 AM<br> Part 2, because
    of post length restrictions<br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps Paradine and Jane
    had evinced too much interest in toys. Emma and Scott took to keeping them hidden, playing with them only in
    private. They never did it overtly, but with a certain unobtrusive caution. Nevertheless, Jane especially was
    somewhat troubled.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She spoke to Paradine about it one
    evening. "That doll Harry gave Emma."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yeah?"<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I was downtown today and tried to find out where it came
    from. No soap."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe Harry bought it in New York."<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jane was unconvinced. "I asked them about the other things,
    too. They showed me their stock&nbsp; Johnson's a big store, you know. But there's nothing like Emma's abacus."<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hm-m-m." Paradine wasn't much interested. They had tickets
    for a show that night, and it was getting late. So the subject was dropped for the nonce.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Later it cropped up again, when a neighbor telephoned
    Jane.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Scotty's never been like that, Denny. Mrs. Burns
    said he frightened the devil out of her Francis."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    "Francis? A little fat bully of a punk, isn't he? Like his father. I broke Burns' nose for him once, when we were
    sophomores."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Stop boasting and listen," Jane said,
    mixing highball. "Scott showed Francis something that scared him. Hadn't you better-"<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I suppose so." Paradine listened. Noises in the next room
    told him the whereabouts of his son. "Scotty!"<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Bang,"
    Scotty said, and appeared smiling. "I killed 'em all. Space pirates. You want me, dad?"<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes. If you don't mind leaving the space pirates unburied
    for a few minutes. What did you do to Francis Burns?"<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Scott's blue eyes reflected incredible candor. "Huh?"<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    "Try hard. You can remember, I'm sure."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Uh. Oh, that. I
    didn't do nothing."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Anything," Jane corrected
    absently.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Anything. Honest, I just let him look into my
    television set, and it&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it scared him."<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Television set?"<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Scott produced the crystal cube. "It isn't really that.
    See?"<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Paradine examined the gadget, startled by the
    magnification. All he could see, though, was a maze of meaningless colored designs.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Uncle Harry-"<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Paradine reached for the telephone. Scott gulped.
    "Is&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is Uncle Harry back in town?"<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yeah."<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, I gotta take a bath." Scott headed for the door.
    Paradine met Jane's gaze and nodded significantly.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Harry
    was home, but disclaimed all knowledge of the peculiar toys. Rather glumly, Paradine requested Scott to bring down
    from his room all of the playthings. Finally they lay in a row on the table, cube, abacus, doll, helmet-like cap,
    several other mysterious contraptions. Scott was cross-examined. He lied valiantly for a time, but broke down at
    last and bawled, hiccupping his confession.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Get the box
    these things came in," Paradine ordered. "The head for bed."<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are
    you&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    hup!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; gonna punish me daddy?"<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "For playing hooky and lying, yes. You know the rules. No
    more shows for two weeks. No sodas for the same period."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Scott gulped. "You gonna keep my things?"<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't know
    yet."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    "Well&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; g'night, daddy. G'night, mom."<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the small figure had gone upstairs, Paradine dragger a
    chair to the table and carefully scrutinized the box. He poked thoughtfully at the fused gadgetry. Jane watched.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is it, Denny?"<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Dunno. Who'd leave a box of toys down by the creek?"<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It might have fallen out of a car."<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Not at that point. The road doesn't hit the creek north of
    the railroad trestle. Empty lots&nbsp; nothing else." Paradine lit a cigarette. "Drink, honey?"<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I'll fix it." Jane went to work, her eyes troubled. She
    brought Paradine a glass and stood behind him, furling his hair with her fingers. "Is anything wrong?"<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course not. Only&nbsp; where did these toys come
    from?"<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Johnsons's didn't know, and they get their stock
    from New York."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I've been checking up, too," Paradine
    admitted. "That doll"&nbsp; he poked it&nbsp; "rather worried me. Custom jobs, maybe, but I wish I knew who'd made
    'em."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "A psychologist? The abacus&nbsp; don't they give
    people tests with such things?"<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Paradine snapped his
    fingers. "Right! And say! There's a guy going to speak at the university next week, fellow named Holloway, who's a
    child psychologist. He's a big shot, with quite a reputation. He might know something about it."<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Holloway? I don't-"<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Rex Holloway.
    He's&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hm-m-m! He doesn't live far from here. Do you
    suppose he might have had these things made himself?"<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Jane was examining the abacus. She grimaced and drew back. "If he did, I don't like him. But see if you can find
    out, Denny."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Paradine nodded. "I shall."<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He drank his highball, frowning. He was vaguely worried. But
    he wasn't scared&nbsp; yet.<br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rex Holloway was a fat,
    shiny man, with a bald head and thick spectacles above which his thick, black brows lay like bushy caterpillars.
    Paradine brought him home to dinner one night a week later. Holloway did not appear to watch the children, but
    nothing they did or said was lost on him. His gray eyes, shred and bright, missed little.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The toys fascinated him. In the living room the three adults
    gathered around the table, where the plaything had been placed. Holloway studied them carefully as he listened to
    what Jane and Paradine had to say. At last he broke his silence.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I'm glad I came here tonight. But not completely. This is
    very disturbing, you know."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Eh?" Paradine stared, and
    Jane's face showed her consternation. Holloway's next words did not calm them.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We are dealing with madness."<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He smiled at the shocked looks they gave him. "All children
    are mad, from an adult viewpoint. Ever read Hughes' 'High Wind in Jamaica'?"<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I've got it." Paradine secured the little book from its
    shelf. Holloway extended a hand, took it, and flipped the pages till he had found the place he wanted. He read
    aloud<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "'Babies of course are not human - they are
    animals, and have a very a very ancient and ramified culture, as cats have, and fishes, and even snakes; the same in
    kind as these, but much more complicated and vivid, since babies are, after all, one of the most developed species
    of the lower vertebrates. In short, babies have minds which work in terms and categories of their own which cannot
    be translated into the terms and categories of the human mind.'"<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jane tried to take that calmly, but couldn't. "You don't mean
    that Emma-"<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Could you think like your daughter?"
    Holloway asked. "Listen 'One can no more think like a baby than one can think like a bee.'"<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Paradine mixed drinks. Over his shoulder he said, "You're
    theorizing quite a bit, aren't you? As I get it, you're implying that babies have a culture of their own, even a
    high standard of intelligence."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Not necessarily. There's
    no yardstick, you see. All I say is that babies think in other ways than we do. Not necessarily better&nbsp; that's
    a question of relative values. But with a different manner of extension-" He sought for the words, grimacing.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Fantasy," Paradine said, rather rudely, but annoyed because
    of Emma. "Babies don't have different senses from ours."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    "Who said they did?" Holloway demanded. "They use their minds in a different way, that's all. But it's quite
    enough!"<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I'm trying to understand," Jane said slowly.
    "All I can think of is my Mixmaster. It can whip up batter and potatoes, but I can squeeze oranges, too."<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Something like that. The brain's a colloid, a very
    complicated machine. We don't know much about its potentialities. We don't even know how much it can grasp. But it
    is known that the mind becomes conditioned as the human animal matures. It follows certain familiar theorems, and
    all thought thereafter is pretty well based on patterns taken for granted. Look at this." Holloway touched the
    abacus. "Have you experimented with it?"<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "A little,"
    Paradine said.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But not much. Eh?"<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well-"<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why not?"<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's pointless," Paradine complained. "Even a puzzle has to
    have some logic. But those crazy angles-"<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your mind has
    been conditioned to Euclid," Holloway said. "So this&nbsp; thing&nbsp; bores us, and seems pointless. But a child
    knows nothing of Euclid. A different sort of geometry from ours wouldn't impress him as being illogical. He believe
    what he sees."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are you trying to tell me that this
    gadget's got a fourth dimensional extension?" Paradine demanded.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Not visually, anyway," Holloway denied. "All I say is that
    our minds, conditioned to Euclid, can see nothing in this but an illogical tangle of wires. But a child&nbsp;
    especially a baby&nbsp; might see more. Not at first. It'd be a puzzle, of course. Only a child wouldn't be
    handicapped by too many preconceived ideas."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hardening
    of the thought-arteries," Jane interjected.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Paradine was
    not convinced. "Then a baby could calculus better than Einstein? No, I don't mean that. I can see your point, more
    or less clearly. Only-"<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, look. Let's suppose there
    are two kinds of geometry&nbsp; we'll limit it, for the sake of the example. Our kind, Euclidean, and another, which
    we'll call x. ]X hasn't much relationship to Euclid. It's based on different theorems. Two and two needn't equal
    four in it; they could equal y, or they might not even equal. A baby's mind is not yet conditioned, except by
    certain questionable factors of heredity and environment. Start the infant on Euclid-"<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Poor kid," Jane said.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Holloway shot her a quick glance. "The basis of Euclid.
    Alphabet blocks. Math, geometry, algebra&nbsp; they come much later. We're familiar with that development. On the
    other hand, start the baby with the basic principles of our x logic."<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Blocks? What kind?"<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Holloway looked at the abacus. "It wouldn't make much sense
    to us. But we've been conditioned to Euclid."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Paradine
    poured himself a stiff shot of whiskey. "That's pretty awful. You're not limiting to math."<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right! I'm not limiting it at all. How can I? I'm not
    conditioned to x logic."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There's the answer," Jane said,
    with a sigh of relief. "Who is? It'd take such a person to make the sort of toys you apparently think these
    are."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Holloway nodded, his eyes, behind the thick lenses,
    blinking. "Such people may exist."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where?"<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "They might prefer to keep hidden."<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Supermen?"<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I wish I knew. You see, Paradine, we've got yardstick
    trouble again. By our standards these people might seem super-doopers in certain respects. In others they might seem
    moronic. It's not a quantitative difference; it's qualitative. They think different. And I'm sure we can do things
    they can't."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe they wouldn't want to," Jane
    said.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Paradine tapped the fused gadgetry on the box.
    "What about this? It implies-"<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "A purpose, sure."<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Transportation?"<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "One thinks of that first, If so, the box might have come
    from anywhere."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where&nbsp; things are = different?"
    Paradine asked slowly.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Exactly. In space, or even time.
    I don't know; I'm a psychologist. Unfortunately I'm conditioned to Euclid, too."<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Funny place it must be," Jane said. "Denny, get rid of those
    toys."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I intend to."<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Holloway picked up the crystal cube. "Did you question the
    children much?"<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Paradine said, "Yeah. Scott said there
    were people in that cube when he first looked. I asked him what was in it now."<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What did he say?" The psychologist's eyes widened.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He said they were building a place. His exact words. I asked
    him who&nbsp; people? But he couldn't explain."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, I
    suppose not," Holloway muttered. "It must be progressive. How long have the children had these toys?"<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "About three months, I guess."<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Time enough. The perfect toy, you see, is both instructive
    and mechanical. It should do things, to interest a child, and it should teach, preferably unobtrusively. Simple
    problems at first. Later-"<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "X logic," Jane said, white
    faced.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Paradine cursed under his breath. "Emma and Scott
    are perfectly normal!"<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you know how their minds
    work&nbsp; now?"<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Holloway didn't pursue the thought. He
    fingered the doll. "It would be interesting to know the conditions of the place where these things came from.
    Induction doesn't help a great deal, though. Too many factors are missing. We can't visualize a world based on the x
    factor&nbsp; environment adjusted to minds thinking in x patterns. This luminous network inside the doll. It could
    be anything. It could exist inside us, though we haven't discovered it yet. When we find the right stain-" He
    shrugged. "What do you make of this?"<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was a crimson
    globe, two inches in diameter, with a protruding knob upon its surface.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What could anyone make of it?"<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Scott? Emma?"<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I hadn't even seen it till about three weeks ago. Then Emma
    started to play with it." Paradine nibbled his lip. "After that, Scott got interested."<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Just what do they do?"<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hold it up in front of them and move it back and forth. No
    particular pattern of motion."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No Euclidean pattern,"
    Holloway corrected. "At first they couldn't understand the toy's purpose. They had to be educated up to it."<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's horrible," Jane said.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Not to them. Emma is probably quicker at understanding x
    than Scott, for her mind isn't yet conditioned to this environment."<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .Paradine said, "But I can remember plenty of things I did as
    a child. Even as a baby."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well?"<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Was I&nbsp; mad&nbsp; then?"<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The things you don't remember are the criterion of your
    madness," Holloway retorted. "But I use the word 'madness' purely as a convenient symbol for the variation from the
    known human norm. The arbitrary standard of sanity."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jane
    put down her glass. "You've said that induction was difficult, Mr. Holloway. But it seems to me you're making a
    great deal of it from very little. After all, these toys-"<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am a psychologist, and I've specialized in children. I'm
    not a layman. These toys mean a great deal to me, chiefly because they mean so little."<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You might be wrong."<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, I rather hope I am. I'd like to examine the
    children."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jane rose in alarm. "How?"<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Holloway had explained, she nodded, though still a bit
    hesitantly. "Well, that's all right. But they're not guinea pigs."<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The psychologist patted the air with a plump hand. "My dear
    girl! I'm not a Frankenstein. To me the individual is the prime factor&nbsp; naturally, since I work with minds. If
    there's anything wrong with the youngsters, I want to cure them."<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Paradine put down his cigarette and slowly watched blue smoke
    spiral up, wavering in an unfelt draft. "Can you give a prognosis.?"<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I'll try. That's all I can say. If the undeveloped minds
    have been turned into the x channel, it's necessary to divert them back. I'm not saying that's the wisest thing to
    do, but it probably is from our standards. After all, Emma and Scott will have to live in this world."<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yeah. Yeah. I can't believe there's much wrong. they seem
    about average, thoroughly normal."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Superficially they
    may seem so. They've no reason for acting abnormally, have they? And how can you tell if they&nbsp; think
    differently?"<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I'll call 'em," Paradine said.<br> "Make
    it informal, then. I don't want them to be on guard."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Jane nodded toward the toys. Holloway said, "Leave the stuff there, eh?"<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the psychologist, after Emma and Scott were summoned,
    made no immediate move at direct questioning. He managed to draw Scott unobtrusively into the conversation, dropping
    key words now and then. nothing so obvious as a word-association test&nbsp; co-operation is necessary for that.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The most interesting development occurred when Holloway took
    up the abacus. "Mind showing me how this works?"<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Scott
    hesitated. "Yes, sir. Like this-" He slid a bead deftly through the maze, in a tangled course, so swiftly that no
    one was quite sure whether or not it ultimately vanished. It might have been merely legerdemain. Then, again-<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Holloway tried. Scott watched, wrinkling his nose.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That right?'<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Uh-huh. It's gotta go there-"<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Here? Why?"<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, that's the only way to make it work."<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But Holloway was conditioned to Euclid. There was no apparent
    reason why the bead should slide from this particular wire to the other. It looked like a random factor. Also,
    Holloway suddenly noticed, this wasn't the path the bead had taken previously, when Scott had worked the puzzle. At
    least, as well as he could tell.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Will you show me
    again?"<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Scott did, and twice more, on request. Holloway
    blinked through his glasses. Random, yes. And variable. Scott moved the bead along a different course each time.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Somehow, none of the adults could tell whether or not the
    bead vanished. If they had expected to see it disappear, their reactions might have been different.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the end, nothing was solved. Holloway, as he said good
    night, seemed ill at ease.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "May I come again?"<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I wish you would," Jane told him. "Any time. You still
    think-"<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He nodded. "The children's minds are not reacting
    normally. They're not dull at all, but I've the most extraordinary impression that they arrive at conclusions in a
    way we don't understand. AS though they used algebra while we used geometry. The same conclusions, but a different
    method of reaching it."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What about the toys?" Paradine
    asked suddenly.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Keep them out of the way. I'd like to
    borrow them, if I may-"<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That night Paradine slept badly.
    Holloway's parallel had been ill-chosen. It led to disturbing theories. The x factor&nbsp; The children were using
    the equivalent of algebraic reasoning, while adults used geometry.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fair enough. Only-<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Algebra can give you answers that geometry cannot, since
    there are certain terms and symbols which cannot be expressed geometrically. Suppose x logic showed conclusions
    inconceivable to an adult mind?<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Damn!" Paradine
    whispered. Jane stirred beside him.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Dear? Can't you
    sleep either?"<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No." He got up and went into the next
    room. Emma slept peacefully as a cherub, her fat arm curled around Mr. Bear. Through the open doorway Paradine could
    see Scott's dark head motionless on the pillow.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jane was
    beside him. He slipped his arm around her.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Poor little
    people," she murmured. "And Holloway called them mad. I think we're the ones who are crazy, Dennis."<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Uh-huh. We've got the jitters."<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Scott stirred in his sleep. Without awakening, he called what
    was obviously a question, though it did not seem to be in any particular language. Emma gave a little mewling cry
    that changed pitch sharply.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She had not awakened. The
    children lay without stirring.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But Paradine though, with
    a sudden sickness in his middle, it was exactly as though Scott had asked Emma something, and she had replied.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Had their minds changed so that even&nbsp; sleep&nbsp; was
    different to them?<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He thrust the thought away. "You'll
    catch cold. Let's get back to bed. Want a drink?"<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I
    think I do," Jane said, watching Emma. Her hand reached out blindly toward the child; she drew it back. "Come on.
    We'll wake the kids."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They drank a little brandy
    together, but said nothing. Jane cried in her sleep, later.<br><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Scott was not awake, but his mind worked in slow, careful
    building. Thus-<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "They'll take the toys away. The fat
    man&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; listava dangerous maybe. But the Ghoric direction
    won't show&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; evankrus dun-hasn't-them.
    Intrasdection&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bright and shiny. Emma. She's more
    khopranik-high now than&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I still don't see how
    to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; thavarar lizery dist-"<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A little of Scott's thoughts could still be understood. But
    Emma had become conditioned to x much faster.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She was
    thinking, too.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not like an adult or a child. Not even
    like a human. Except, perhaps, a human of a type shockingly unfamiliar to genus homo.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sometimes Scott himself had difficulty in following her
    thoughts.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If it had not been for Holloway, life might
    have settled back into an almost normal routine. The toys were no longer active reminders. Emma still enjoyed her
    dolls and sand pile, with a thoroughly explicable delight. Scott was satisfied with baseball and his chemical set.
    They did everything other children did, and evinced few, if any, flashes of abnormality. But Holloway seemed to be
    an alarmist.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was having the toys tested, with rather
    idiotic results. He drew endless charts and diagrams, corresponded with mathematicians, engineers, and other
    psychologists, and went quietly crazy trying to find rhyme or reason in the construction of the gadgets. The box
    itself, with its cryptic machinery, told nothing. Fusing had melted too much of the stuff into slag. But the
    toys-<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was the random element that baffled
    investigation. Even that was a matter of semantics. For Holloway was convince that it wasn't really random. There
    just weren't enough known factors. No adult could work the abacus, for example. And Holloway thoughtfully refrained
    from letting a child play with the thing.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The crystal
    cube was similarly cryptic. It showed a mad pattern of colors, which sometimes moved. In this it resembled a
    kaleidoscope. But the shifting of balance and gravity didn't affect it. Again the random factor.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Or, rather, the unknown. The x pattern. Eventually Paradine
    and Jane slipped back into something like complacence, with a feeling that the children had been cured of their
    mental quick, now that the contributing cause had been removed. Certain of the actions of Emma and Scott gave them
    every reason to quit worrying.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the kids enjoyed
    swimming, hiking, movies, games, the normal functional toys of this particular time-sector. It was true that they
    failed to master certain rather puzzling mechanical devices which involved some calculation. A three-dimensional
    jigsaw globe Paradine had picked up, for example. But he found that difficult himself.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once in a while there were lapses. Scott was hiking with his
    father one Saturday afternoon, and the two had paused at the summit of a hill. Beneath them a rather lovely valley
    was spread.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Pretty, isn't it?" Paradine remarked.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Scott examined the scene gravely. "It's all wrong," he
    said.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Eh?"<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I dunno."<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's wrong about it?<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Gee-" Scott lapsed into puzzled silence. "I dunno."<br><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The children had missed their toys, but not for long. Emma
    recovered first, though Scott still moped. He held unintelligible conversations with his sister, and studied
    meaningless scrawls she drew on paper he supplied. It was almost as though he was consulting her, anent difficult
    problems beyond his grasp.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If Emma understood more, Scott
    had more real intelligence, and manipulatory skill as well. He built a gadget with his Meccano set, but was
    dissatisfied. the apparent cause of his dissatisfaction was exactly why Paradine was relieved when he viewed the
    structure. It was the sort of thing a normal boy would make, vaguely reminiscent of a cubistic ship.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was a bit too normal to please Scott. He asked Emma more
    questions, though in private. She thought for a time, and then made more scrawls with an awkwardly clutched
    pencil.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can you read that stuff?" Jane asked her son one
    morning.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Not read it, exactly. I can tell what she
    means. Not all the time, but mostly."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it
    writing?"<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "N-no. It doesn't mean what it looks like."<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Symbolism," Paradine suggested over his coffee.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jane looked at him, her eyes widening. "Denny-"<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He winked and shook his head. Later, when they were alone, he
    said, "Don't let Holloway upset you. I'm not implying the kids are corresponding in an unknown tongue. If Emma draws
    a squiggle and says it's a flower, that's an arbitrary rule&nbsp; Scott remembers that. Next time she draws the same
    sort of squiggle, or tries to&nbsp; well!"<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sure," Jane
    said doubtfully. "Have you noticed Scott's been doing a lot of reading lately?"<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I noticed. Nothing unusual, though. No Kant or Spinoza."<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He browses, that's all."<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, so did I, at his age," Paradine said, and went off to
    his morning classes. He lunched with Holloway, which was becoming a daily habit, and spoke of Emma's literary
    endeavors.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Was I right about symbolism, Rex?"<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The psychologist nodded. "Quite right. Our own language is
    nothing but arbitrary symbolism now. At least in its application. Look here." On his napkin he drew a very narrow
    ellipse. "What's that?"<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You mean what does it
    represent?"<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes. What does it suggest to you? It could
    be a crude representation of -what?"<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Plenty of things,"
    Paradine said. "Rim of a glass. A fried egg. A loaf of French bread. A cigar."<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Holloway added a little triangle to his drawing, apex joined
    to one end of the ellipse. He looked up at Paradine.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "A
    fish," the latter said instantly.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Our familiar symbol
    for a fish. Even without fins, eyes or mouth, it's recognizable, because we've been conditioned to identify this
    particular shape with our mental picture of a fish. The basis of a rebus. A symbol, to us, means a lot more than
    what we actually see on paper. What's in your mind when you look at this sketch?"<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why&nbsp; a fish."<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Keep going. What do you visualize&nbsp; everything!"<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Scales," Paradine said slowly, looking into space. "Water.
    Foam. A fish's eye. The fins. The colors."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So the symbol
    represents a lot more than just the abstract idea fish. Note the connotation's that of a noun, not a verb. It's
    harder to express actions by symbolism, you know. Anyway&nbsp; reverse the process. Suppose you want to make a
    symbol for some concrete noun, say bird. Draw it."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Paradine drew two connected arcs, concavities down.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The
    lowest common denominator," Holloway nodded. "The natural tendency is to simplify. Especially when a child is seeing
    something for the first time and has few standards of comparison. He tries to identify the new thing with what's
    already familiar to him. Ever notice how a child draws the ocean?" He didn't wait for an answer; he went on.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "A series of jagged points. Like the oscillating line on a
    seismograph. When I first saw the Pacific, I was about three. I remember it pretty clearly. It looked&nbsp; tilted.
    A flat plain, slanted at an angle. The waves were regular triangles, apex upward. Now I don't see them stylized that
    way, but later, remembering, I had to find some familiar standard of comparison. Which is the only way of getting
    any conception of an entirely new thing. The average child tries to draw these regular triangles, but his
    coordination's poor. He gets a seismograph pattern."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "All
    of which means what?"<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "A child sees the ocean. He
    stylizes it. He draws a certain definite pattern, symbolic, to him, of the sea. Emma's scrawls may be symbols, too.
    I don't mean that the world looks different to her&nbsp; brighter, perhaps, and sharper, more vivid with a
    slackening of perception above her eye level. What I do mean is that her though-processes are different, that she
    translates what she sees into abnormal symbols."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You
    still believe-"<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, I do. Her mind has been conditioned
    unusually. It may be that she breaks down what she sees into simple, obvious patterns&nbsp; and realizes a
    significance to those patterns that we can't understand. Like the abacus. She saw a pattern in that, though to us it
    was completely random."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Paradine abruptly decided to
    taper off these luncheon engagements with Holloway. The man was an alarmist. His theories were growing more
    fantastic than ever, and he dragged in anything, applicable or not, that would support them.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rather sardonically he said, "Do you mean Emma's
    communicating with Scott in an unknown language?"<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In
    symbols for which she hasn't any words. I'm sure Scott understands a great deal of those&nbsp; scrawls. To him, an
    isosceles triangle may represent any factor, though probably a concrete noun. Would a man who nothing of algebra
    understand what H²O meant? Would he realize that the symbol could evoke a picture of the ocean?"<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Paradine didn't answer. Instead, he mentioned to Holloway
    Scott's curious remark that the landscape, from the hill, had looked all wrong. A moment later, he was inclined to
    regret his impulse, for the psychologist was off again.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    "Scott's thought-patterns are building up to a sum that doesn't equal this world. Perhaps he's subconsciously
    expecting to see the world where those toys came from."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Paradine stopped listening. Enough was enough. The kids were getting along all right, and the only remaining
    disturbing factor was Holloway himself. That night, however, Scott evinced an interest, later significant, in
    eels.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There was nothing apparently harmful in natural
    history. Paradine explained about eels.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But where do
    they lay their eggs? Pr do they?"<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's still a
    mystery. Their spawning grounds are unknown. Maybe the Sargasso Sea, or the deeps, where the pressure can help them
    force the young out of their bodies."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Funny," Scott
    said, thinking deeply.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Salmon do the same thing, more or
    less. They go up rivers to spawn." Paradine went into detail. Scott was fascinated.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But that's right, dad. They're born in the river, and then
    they learn how to swim, they go down to the sea. And they come back to lay their eggs, huh?"<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right."<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Only, they wouldn't come back," Scott pondered. "They'd just
    send their eggs-"<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It'd take a very long ovipositor,"
    Paradine said, and vouchsafed some well-chosen remarks upon oviparity.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His son wasn't entirely satisfied. Flowers, he contended,
    sent their seeds long distances.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "They don't guide them.
    Not many find fertile soil."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Flowers haven't got brains,
    though. Dad, why do people live here?"<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Glendale?"<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No&nbsp; here. This whole place. It isn't all there is, I
    bet."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you mean the other planets?"<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Scott was hesitant. "This is only&nbsp; part of the big
    place. It's like the river where the salmon go. Why don't people go on down to the ocean when they grow up?"<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Paradine realized that Scott was speaking figuratively. He
    felt a brief chill. The&nbsp; ocean?<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The young of the
    species are not conditions to live in the completer world of their parents. Having developed sufficiently, they
    enter that world. Later they breed. The fertilized eggs are buried in the sand, far up the river, where later they
    hatch.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And they learn. Instinct alone is fatally slow.
    Especially in the case of a specialized genus, unable to cope even with this world, unable to feed or drink or
    survive, unless someone has foresightedly provided for those needs.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The young, fed and tended, would survive. There would be
    incubators and robots. They would survive, but they would not know how to swim downstream, to the vaster world of
    the ocean.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So they must be taught. They must be trained
    and conditioned in many ways.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Painlessly, subtly,
    unobtrusively. Children love toys that do things&nbsp; and if those toys teach at the same time-<br><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the latter half of the nineteenth century and Englishman
    sat on a grassy bank near a stream. A very small girl lay near him, staring up at the sky. She had discarded a
    curious toy with which she had been playing, and now was murmuring a wordless little song, to which the man listened
    to with half an ear.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What was that, my dear?" he asked
    at last.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Just something I made up, Uncle Charles."<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sing it again." He pulled out a notebook.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The girl obeyed.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Does it mean anything?"<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She nodded. "Oh, yes. Like the stories I tell you, you
    know."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "They're wonderful stories, dear."<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "And you'll put them in a book some day?"<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, but I must change them quite a lot, or no one would
    understand. But I don't think I'll change your little song."<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You mustn't. If you did, it wouldn't mean anything."<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I won't change that stanza, anyway," he promised. "Just what
    does it mean?"<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's the way out, I think," the girl said
    doubtfully. "I'm not sure yet. My magic toys told me."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I
    wish I knew what London shop sold those marvelous toys!"<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    "Mamma bought them for me. She's dead. Papa doesn't care."<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She lied. She had found the toys in a box one day, as she
    played by the Thames. And they were indeed wonderful.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her
    little song&nbsp; Uncle Charles thought it didn't mean anything. (He wasn't her real uncle, she parenthesized. But
    he was nice.) The song meant a great deal. It was the way. Presently she would do what it said, and then-<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But she was already too old. She never found the way.<br><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Paradine had dropped Holloway. Jane had taken a dislike to
    him, naturally enough, since what she wanted most of all was to have her fears calmed. Since Scott and Emma acted
    normally now, Jane felt satisfied. It was partly wishful-thinking, to which Paradine could not entirely
    subscribe.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Scott kept brining gadgets to Emma for her
    approval. Usually she'd shake her head. Sometimes she would signify agreement. Then there would be an hour of
    laborious, crazy scribbling on scraps of note paper, and Scott, after studying the notations, would arrange and
    rearrange his rocks, bits of machinery, candle ends, and assorted junk. Each day the maid cleaned them away, and
    each day Scott began again.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He condescended to explain a
    little to his puzzled father, who could see no rhyme or reason in the game.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But why this pebble right here?"<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's hard and round, dad. It belongs there."<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So is this one hard and round."<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, that's got Vaseline on it. When you get that far, you
    can't see just a hard round thing."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What comes next?
    This candle?"<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Scott looked disgusted. "That's toward the
    end. The iron ring's next."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was, Paradine thought,
    like a Scout trail through the woods, markers in a labyrinth. But here again was the random factor. Logic
    halted&nbsp; familiar logic&nbsp; as Scott's motives in arranging the junk as he did.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Paradine went out. Over his shoulder he saw Scott pull a
    crumpled piece of paper and a pencil from his pocket, and head for Emma, who was squatted in a corner thinking
    things over.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well-<br><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jane was lunching with Uncle Harry, and, on this hot Sunday
    afternoon there was little to do but read the papers. Paradine settled himself in the coolest place he could find,
    with a Collins, and lost himself in the comic strips.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An
    hour later a clatter of feet upstairs roused him from his doze. Scott's voice was crying exultantly, "This is it,
    Slug! Come on-"<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Paradine stood up quickly, frowning. As
    he went into the hall the telephone began to ring. Jane had promised to call-<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His hand was on the receiver when Emma's faint voice squealed
    in excitement. Paradine grimaced. What the devil was going on upstairs?<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Scott shrieked, "Look out! This way!"<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Paradine, his mouth working, his nerves ridiculously tense,
    forgot the phone and raced up the stairs. The door of Scott's room was open.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The children were vanishing.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They went in fragments, like thick smoke in a wind, or like
    movement in a distorting mirror. Hand in hand they went, in a direction Paradine could not understand, and as he
    blinked there on the threshold, they were gone.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Emma!"
    he said, dry-throated. "Scotty!"<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On carpet lay a pattern
    of markers, pebbles, an iron ring&nbsp; junk. A random pattern. A crumpled sheet of paper blew towards Paradine.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He picked it up automatically.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Kids. Where are you? Don't hide-"<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Emma! SCOTTY!"<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Downstairs the telephone stopped its shrill, monotonous
    ringing. Paradine looked at the paper he held.<br> It was a leaf torn from a book. there were interlineations and
    marginal notes, in Emma's meaningless scrawl. A stanza of verse had been so underlined and scribbled over that it
    was almost illegible, but Paradine was thoroughly familiar with "Through the Looking Glass." His memory gave him the
    words-<br><br> 'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves<br> Did gyre and gimbel in the wabe.<br> All mimsy were the
    borogoves,<br> And the mome raths outgrabe.<br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Idiotically he thought Humpty Dumpty explained it. A wabe is the plot of grass around a sundial. A sundial.
    Time&nbsp; it has something to do with time. A long time ago Scotty asked me what a wabe was. Symbolism.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Twas brillig-<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A perfect mathematical formula, giving all the conditions, in
    symbolism the children had finally understood. The junk on the floor. The toves had to be made slithy&nbsp;
    Vaseline?&nbsp; and they had to be placed in a certain relationship, so that they'd gyre and gimbel.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lunacy!<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But it had not been lunacy to Emma and Scott. They thought
    differently. They used x logic. Those notes Emma had made on the page&nbsp; she'd translated Carroll's words into
    symbols both she and Scott could understand.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The random
    factor had made sense to the children. They had fulfilled the conditions of the time-space equation. And the mome
    raths outgrabe-<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Paradine made a rather ghastly little
    sound, deep in his throat. He looked at the crazy pattern on the carpet. If he could follow it, as the kids had
    done&nbsp; but he couldn't. The pattern was senseless. The random factor defeated him. He was conditioned to
    Euclid.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if he went insane, he still couldn't do it.
    It would be the wrong kind of lunacy.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His mind had
    stopped working now. But in a moment the stasis of incredulous horror would pass&nbsp; Paradine crumpled the page in
    his fingers. "Emma, Scotty," he called in a dead voice, as though he could expect no response.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sunlight slanted through the open windows, brightening the
    golden pelt of Mr. Bear. Downstairs the ringing of the telephone began again.<br><br> <br><br> <br>
