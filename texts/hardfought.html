    <h1>Hardfought</h1>
    <p>By Greg Bear</p>
    <br>
    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> Humans called it the Medusa. Its long twisted ribbons of gas strayed across
        fifty parsecs, glowing blue, yellow, and carmine. Its central core was a ghoulish green flecked with watery
        black. Half a dozen protostars circled the core, and as many more dim conglomerates pooled in dimples in the
        nebula's magnetic field. The Medusa was a huge womb of stars —and disputed territory.</span></p>
    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> Whenever Prufrax looked at it in displays or through the ship's ports, it
        seemed malevolent, like a zealous mother displaying an ominous face to protect her children. Prufrax had never
        had a mother, but she had seen them in some of the fibs.</span></p>
    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> At five, Prufrax was old enough to know the Mellangee's mission and her role
        in it. She had already been through four ship-years of indoctrination. Until her first battle she would be
        educated in both the Know and the Tell. She would be exercised and trained in the Mocks; in sleep she would
        dream of penetrating the huge red-and-white Senexi seedships and finding the brood mind. "Zap, Zap," she went
        with her lips, silent so the tellman wouldn't think her thoughts were straying.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> The tellman peered at her from his position in the center of the spherical
        classroom. Her mates stared straight at the center, all focusing somewhere around the tellman's spiderlike
        teaching desk, waiting for the trouble, some fidgeting. "How many branch mindividuals in the Senexi brood mind?"
        he asked. He looked around the classroom. Peered face by face. Focused on her again. "Pru?"</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "Five," she said. Her arms ached. She had been pumped full of moans the wake
        before. She was already three meters tall, in elfstate, with her long, thin limbs not nearly adequately fleshed
        out and her fingers still crisscrossed with the surgery done to adapt them to the gloves.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "What will you find in the brood mind?" the tellman pursued, his impassive
        face stretched across a hammerhead as wide as his shoulders. Some of the ferns thought tellmen were attractive.
        Not many—and Pru was not one of them.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "Yoke," she said.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "What is in the brood-mind yoke?"</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "Fibs."</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "More specifically? And it really isn't all fib, you know." </span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "Info. Senexi data."</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "What will you do?"</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "Zap," she said, smiling.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "Why, Pru?"</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "Yoke has team gens-memory. Zap yoke, spill the life of the team's five
        branch minds."</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "Zap the brood, Pru?"</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "No," she said solemnly. That was a new instruction, only in effect since
        her class's inception. "Hold the brood for the supreme overs." The tellmen did not say what would be done with
        the Senexi broods. That was not her concern.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "Fine," said the tellman. "You tell well, for someone who's always
        half-journeying."</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> She was already five, soon six. Old. Some saw Senexi by the time they were
        four.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "Zap, Zap," she went with her lips.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> </span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> Aryz skidded through the thin layer of liquid ammonia on his broadest pod,
        considering his new assignment. He knew the Medusa by another name, one that conveyed all the time and effort
        the Senexi had invested in it. The protostar nebula held few mysteries for him. He and his four branch-mates,
        who along with the all-important brood mind made up one of the six teams aboard the seedship, had patrolled the
        nebula for ninety-three orbits, each orbit—including the timeless periods outside status geometry—taking some
        one hundred and thirty human years. They had woven in and out of the tendrils of gas, charting the infalling
        masses and exploring the rocky accretion disks of stars entering the main sequence. With each measure and
        update, the brood minds refined their view of the nebula as it would be a hundred generations hence when the
        Senexi plan would finally mature.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> The Senexi were nearly as old as the galaxy. They had achieved spaceflight
        during the time of the starglobe when the galaxy had been a sphere. They had not been a quick or brilliant race.
        Each great achievement had taken thousands of generations, and not just because of their intellectual handicaps.
        In those times elements heavier than helium had been rare, round only around stars that had greedily absorbed
        huge amounts of primeval hydrogen, burned fierce and blue, and exploded early, permeating the ill-defined
        galactic arms with carbon and nitrogen, lithium and oxygen. Elements heavier than iron had been almost
        nonexistent. The biologies of cold gas-giant worlds had developed with a much smaller palette of chemical
        combinations in producing the offspring of the primary Population II stars.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> Aryz, even with the limited perspective of a branch mind, was aware that, on
        the whole, the humans opposing the seed-ship were more adaptable, more vital. But they were not more
        experienced. The Senexi with their billions of years had often matched them. And Aryz's perspective was
        expanding with each day of his new assignment.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> In the early generations of the struggle, Senexi mental stasis and cultural
        inflexibility had made them avoid contact with the Population I species. They had never begun a program of
        extermination of the younger, newly life-forming worlds; the task would have been monumental and probably
        useless. So when spacefaring cultures developed, the Senexi had retreated, falling back into the redoubts of old
        stars even before engaging with the new kinds. They had retreated for three generations, about thirty thousand
        human years, raising their broods on cold nestworlds around red dwarfs, conserving, holding back for the
        inevitable conflicts.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> As the Senexi had anticipated, the younger Population I races had found need
        of even the aging groves of the galaxy's first stars. They had moved in savagely, voraciously, with all the
        strength and mutability of organisms evolved from a richer soup of elements. Biology had, in some ways, evolved
        in its own right and superseded the Senexi.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> Aryz raised the upper globe of his body, with its five silicate eyes
        arranged in a cross along the forward surface. He had memory of those times, and times long before, though his
        twain hadn't existed then. The brood mind carried memories selected from the total store of nearly twelve
        billion years' experience, an awesome amount of knowledge, even to a Senexi. He pushed himself forward with his
        rear pods.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> Through the brood mind Aryz could share the memories of a hundred thousand
        past generations, yet the brood mind itself was younger than its branch mindividuals. For a time in their youth,
        in their liquid-dwelling larval form, the branch minds carried their own sacs of data, each a fragment of the
        total necessary for complete memory. The branch minds swam through ammonia seas and wafted through thick warm
        gaseous zones, protoplasmic blobs three to four meters in diameter developing their personalities under the
        weight of the past; and not even a complete past. No wonder they were inflexible Aryz thought. Most branch minds
        were aware enough to see that—especially when they were allowed to compare histories with the Population I
        species, as he was doing--but there was nothing to be done. They were content Oa s they were. To change would be
        unspeakably repugnant. Extinction was preferable . . . almost.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> But now they were pressed hard. The brood mind had to m a number of
        experiments. Aryz's team had been selected from the seedship's contingent to oversee the experiments, and Aryz
        had been chosen as the chief investigator. Two orbits past, they had captured six human embryos in a breeding
        device, as well as a highly coveted memory storage center. Most Senexi engagements had been with humans for the
        past three or four generations. Just as the Senexi dominated Population II species, humans were ascendant among
        their kind.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> Experiments with the human embryos had already been conducted. Some had been
        allowed to develop normally; others had been tampered with, for reasons Aryz was not aware of. The tamperings
        had not been very successful.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> The newer experiments, Aryz suspected, were going to take a different
        direction, and the seedship's actions now focused on him; he believed he would be given complete authority over
        the human shapes. Most branch minds would have dissipated under such a burden, but not Aryz. He found the human
        shapes rather interesting, in their own horrible way. They might, after all, be the key to Senexi
        survival.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> </span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> The moans were toughening her elfstate. She lay in pain for a wake, not
        daring to close her eyes; her mind was changing and she feared sleep would be the end of her. Her nightmares
        were not easily separated from life; some, in fact, were sharper.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> Too often in sleep she found herself in a Senexi trap, struggling uselessly,
        being pulled in deeper, her hatred wasted against such power.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> When she came out of the rigor, Prufrax was given leave by the subordinate
        tellman. She took to the Mellangee's greenroads, walking stiffly in the shallow gravity. Her hands itched. Her
        mind seemed almost empty after the turmoil of the past few wakes. She had never felt so calm and clear. She
        hated the Senexi double now; once for their innate evil, twice for what they had made her overs put her through
        to be able to fight them. She was growing more mature wake by wake. Fight-budding, the tellman called it, hate
        coming out like blooms, synthesizing the sunlight of his teaching into pure fight.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> The greenroads rose temporarily beyond the labyrinth shields and armor of
        the ship. Simple transparent plastic-and-steel geodesic surfaces formed a lacework over the gardens, admitting
        radiation necessary to the vegetation growing along the paths.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> Prufrax looked down on the greens to each side of the paths without much
        comprehension. They were beautiful. Yes, one should say that, think that, but what did it mean? Pleasing? She
        wasn't sure what being pleased meant, outside of thinking Zap. She sniffed a flower that, the signs explained,
        bloomed only in the light of young stars not yet fusing. They were near such a star now, and the greenroads were
        shiny black and electric green with the blossoms. Lamps had been set out for other plants unsuited to such
        darkened conditions. Some technic allowed suns to appear in selected plastic panels when viewed from certain
        angles. Clever, the technicals.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> She much preferred the looks of a technical to a tellman, but she was common
        in that. She wished a technical were on the greenroads with her. The moans had the effect of makingher
        receptive—what she saw, looking in mirrors, was a certain shine in her eyes—but there was no chance of a
        breeding liaison. She was quite unreproductive in this moment of elf-state.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> She looked up and saw a figure at least a hundred meters away, sitting on an
        allowed patch near the path. She walked casually, as gracefully as possible with the stiffness. Not a technical,
        she saw soon, but she was not disappointed. Too calm.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "Over," he said as she approached.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "Under," she replied. But not by much—he was probably six or seven
        ship-years old and not easily classifiable.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "Such a fine elfstate," he commented. His hair was black. He was shorter
        than she, but something in his build reminded her of the glovers. He motioned for her to sit, and she did so
        with a whuff, massaging her knees.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "Moans?" he asked.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "Bad stretch," she said.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "You're a glover." He was looking at the fading scars on her hands.</span>
    </p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "Can't tell what you are," she said.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "Noncombat," he said. "Tuner of the mandates."</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> She knew very little about the mandates, except that law decreed every ship
        carry one, and few of the crew were ever allowed to peep. "Noncombat, hm?" She mused. She didn't despise him for
        that; one never felt strongs negatives for a crew member.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "Been working on ours this wake," he said. "Too hard, I guess. Told to
        talk." Overzealousness in work was considered an erotic trait aboard the Mellangee. Still, she didn't feel too
        receptive toward him.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "Glovers walk after a rough growing," she said.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> He nodded. "My name's Clevo."</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "Prufrax."</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "Combat soon?"</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "Hoping. Waiting forever."</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "I know. Just been allowed access to the mandate for a half-dozen wakes. All
        new to me. Very happy."</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "Can you talk about it?" she asked. Information about the ship not
        accessible in certain rates was excellent barter. "Not sure," he said, frowning. "I've been told
        caution."</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "Well, I'm listening."</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> He could come from glover stock, she thought, but probably not from
        technical. He wasn't very muscular, but he wasn't as tall as a glover, or as thin, either.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "If you'll tell me about gloves."</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> With a smile she held up her hands and wriggled the short, stumpy fingers.
        "Sure."</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> </span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> The brood mind floated weightless in its tank, held in place by buffered
        carbon rods. Metal was at a premium aboard the Senexi ships, more out of tradition than actual material
        limitations.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> Aryz floated before the brood mind, all these thoughts coursing through his
        tissues. He had no central nervous system, no truly differentiated organs except those that dealt with the
        outside world—limbs, eyes, perinea. The brood mind, however, was all central nervous system, a thinly buffered
        sac of viscous fluids about ten meters wide.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "Have you investigated the human memory device yet?" the brood mind
        asked.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "I have."</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "Is communication with the human shapes possible for us?"</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "We have already created interfaces for dealing with their machines. Yes, it
        seems likely we can communicate."</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "Does it strike you that in our long war with humans, we have made no
        attempt to communicate before?"</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> This was a complicated question. It called for several qualities that Aryz,
        as a branch mind, wasn't supposed to have. Inquisitiveness, for one. branch minds did not ask questions. They
        exhibited initiative only as offshoots of the brood mind.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> He found, much to his dismay, that the question had occurred to him. "We
        have never captured a human memory store before," he said, by way of incomplete answer. "We could not have
        communicated without such an extensive source of information."</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "Yet, as you say, even in the past we have been able to use human
        machines."</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "The problem is vastly more complex."</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> The brood mind paused. "Do you think the teams have been prohibited from
        communicating with humans?"</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> Aryz felt the closest thing to anguish possible for a branch mind. Was he
        being considered unworthy? Accused of conduct inappropriate to a branch mind? His loyalty the brood mind was
        unshakeable. "Yes."</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "And what might our reasons be?"</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "Avoidance of pollution."</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "Correct. We can no more communicate with them and remain untainted than we
        can walk on their worlds, breathe their atmosphere.” Again, silence. Aryz lapsed into a mode of inactivity. When
        the brood mind readdressed him, he was instantly aware.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "Do you know how you are different?" it asked.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "I am not . . ." Again, hesitation. Lying to the brood mind was impossible
        for him. He signalled his distress.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "You are useful to the team," the brood mind said. Aryz calmed instantly.
        His thoughts became sluggish, receptive. There was a possibility of redemption. But how was he different? "You
        are to attempt communication with the shapes yourself. You will not engage in any discourse with your fellows
        while you are so involved." He was banned. "And after completion of this mission and transfer of certain facts
        to me, you will dissipate."</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> Aryz struggled with the complexity of the orders. "How am I different,
        worthy of such a commission?"</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> The surface of the brood mind was as still as an undisturbed pool. The
        indistinct black smudges that marked its radiating organs circulated slowly within the interior, then returned,
        one above the other, to focus on him. "You will grow a new branch mind. It will not have your flaws, but, then
        again, it will not be useful to me should such a situation come a second time. Your dissipation will be a
        relief, but it will be regretted."</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "How am I different?"</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "I think you know already," the brood mind said. "When the time comes, you
        will feed the new branch mind all your memories but those of human contact. If you do not survive to that stage
        of its growth, you will pick your fellow who will perform that function for you."</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> A small pinkish spot appeared on the back of Aryz's globe. He floated
        forward and placed his largest perineum against the brood mind's cool surface. The key and command were passed,
        and his body became capable of reproduction. Then the signal of dismissal was given. He left the chamber.</span>
    </p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> Flowing through the thin stream of liquid ammonia lining the corridor, he
        felt ambiguously stimulated. His was a position of privilege and anathema. He had been blessed—and condemned.
        Had any other branch mind experienced such a thing?</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> Then he knew the brood mind was correct. He was different from his fellows.
        None of them would have asked such questions. None of them could have survived the suggestion of communicating
        with human shapes. If this task hadn't been given to him, he would have had to dissipate anyway.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> The pink spot grew larger, then began to make grayish flakes. It broke
        through the skin, and casually, almost without thinking, Aryz scraped it off against a bulkhead. It clung, made
        a radio-frequency emanation something like a sigh, and began absorbing nutrients from the ammonia.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> Aryz went to inspect the shapes.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> </span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> She was intrigued by Clevo, but the kind of interest she felt was new to
        her. She was not particularly receptive. Rather, she felt a mental gnawing as if she were hungry or had been
        injected with some kind of brain moans. What Clevo told her about the mandates opened up a topic she had never
        considered before. How did all things come to be—and how did she figure in them?</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> The mandates were quite small, Clevo explained, each little more than a
        cubic meter in volume. Within them was the entire history and culture of the human species, as accurate as
        possible, culled from all existing sources. The mandate in each ship was updated whenever the ship returned to a
        contact station.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> Clevo had been assigned small tasks—checking data and adding ship
        records—that had allowed him to sample bits of the mandate. "It's mandated that we have records," he explained,
        "and what we have, you see, is man-data." He smiled. "That's a joke," he said. "Sort of."</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> Prufrax nodded solemnly. "So where do we come from?" "Earth, of course,"
        Clevo said. "Everyone knows that." "I mean, where do we come from—you and I, the crew." "Breeding division. Why
        ask? You know."</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "Yes." She frowned, concentrating. "I mean, we don't come from the same
        place as the Senexi. The same way." "No, that's foolishness."</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> She saw that it was foolishness—the Senexi were different all around. What
        was she struggling to ask? "Is their fib like our own?"</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "Fib? History's not a fib. Not most of it, anyway. Fibs are for unreal.
        History is over fib."</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> She knew, in a vague way, that fibs were unreal. She didn't like to have
        their comfort demeaned, though. "Fibs are fun," she said. "They teach Zap."</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "I suppose," Clevo said dubiously. "Being noncombat, I don't see Zap
        fibs."</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> Fibs without Zap were almost unthinkable to her. "Such dull," she
        said.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "Well, of course you'd say that. I might find Zap fibs dull —think of
        that?"</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "We're different," she said. "Like Senexi are different."</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> Clevo's jaw hung open. "No way. We're crew. We're human. Senexi are ..." He
        shook his head as if fed bitters.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "No, I mean ..." She paused, uncertain whether she was entering unallowed
        territory. "You and I, we're fed different, given different moans. But in a big way we're different from Senexi.
        They aren't made, nor act, as you and I. But ..." Again it was difficult to express. She was irritated. "I don't
        want to talk to you anymore."</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> A tellman walked down the path, not familiar to Prufrax. He held out his
        hand for Clevo, and Clevo grasped it. "It's amazing," the tellman said, "how you two gravitate to each other.
        Go, elfstate," he addressed Prufrax. "You're on the wrong greenroad."</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> She never saw the young researcher again. With glover training under way,
        the itches he aroused soon faded, and Zap resumed its overplace.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> </span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> The Senexi had ways of knowing humans were near. As information came in
        about fleets and individual cruisers less than one percent nebula diameter distant, the seedship seemed warmer,
        less hospitable. Everything was UV with anxiety, and the new branch mind on the wall had to be shielded by a
        special silicate cup to prevent distortion. The brood mind grew a corniculum automatically, though the toughened
        outer membrane would be of little help if the seedship was breached.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> Aryz had buried his personal confusion under a load of work. He had
        penetrated the human memory store deeply enough to find instructions on its use. It called itself a mandate and
        even the simple preliminary directions were difficult for Aryz. It was like swimming in another family's private
        sea, though of course infinitely more alien; how could he connect with experiences never had, problems and needs
        never encountered by his kind?</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> He observed the new branch mind once or twice each watch period. Never before
        had he seen an induced replacement. The normal process was for two brood minds to exchange plasm and form new
        team buds, then to exchange and nurture the buds. The buds were later cast free to swim as individual larvae.
        While the larvae swam through the liquid and gas atmosphere of a Senexi world often for thousands, even tens of
        thousands of kilometers, inevitably they returned to gather with the other buds of their team. Replacements were
        selected from a separately created pool of "generic" buds only if one or more originals had been destroyed
        during their wanderings. The destruction of a complete team meant reproductive failure.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> In a mature team, only when a branch mind was destroyed did the brood mind
        induce a replacement. In essence, then, Aryz was already considered dead.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> Yet he was still useful. That amused him, if the Senexi emotion could be
        called amusement. Restricting himself from his fellows was difficult, but he filled the time by immersing
        himself, through the interface, in the mandate.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> The humans were also connected with the mandate through their surrogate
        parent, and in this manner they were quiescent.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> He reported infrequently to the broodmind. Until he had established
        communication, there was little to report.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> And throughout his turmoil, like the others he could sense a fight was
        coming. It could determine the success or failure of all their work in the nebula. In the grand scheme, failure
        here might not be crucial. But the Senexi had taken the long view too often in the past.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> And he knew himself well enough to doubt he would fail. He could feel an
        affinity for the humans already. Peering at them through the thick glass wall in their isolated chamber, his
        skin paling at the thought of their heat, their poisonous chemistry. A diseased affinity. He hated himself for
        it. And reveled in it. It was what made him particularly useful to the team. If he was defective, and this was
        the only way he could serve, then so be it.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> The other branch minds observed his passings from a distance, making no
        judgments. Aryz was dead, though he worked and moved. His sacrifice had been fearful. Yet he would not be a
        hero. His kind could never be emulated.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> It was a horrible time, a horrible conflict.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> </span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> She floated in language, learned it in a trice; there were no distractions.
        She floated in history and picked up as much as she could, for the source seemed inexhaustible. She tried to
        distinguish between eyes-open—the barren, pale gray-brown chamber with the thick green wall, beyond which
        floated a murky roundness—and eyes-shut, when she dropped back into language and history with no fixed
        foundation.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> Eyes-open, she saw the Mam with its comforting limbs and its soft voice, its
        tubes and extrusions of food and its hissings and removal of waste. Through Mam's wires she learned. Mam also
        tended another like herself, and another unlike either of them, more like the shape beyond the green
        wall.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> She was very young, and it was all a mystery.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> At least she knew her name. And what she was supposed to do. She took small
        comfort in that.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> </span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> They fitted Prufrax with her gloves, and she went into the practice chamber,
        dragged by her gloves almost, for she hadn't yet knitted the plug-in nerves in her right index digit and her
        pace control was uncertain.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> There, for six wakes straight, she flew with the other glovers back and
        forth across the dark spaces like elfstate comets. Constellations and nebula aspects flashed at random on the
        distant walls, and she oriented to them like a night-flying bird. Her glovemates were Ornin, an especially
        slender male, and Ban, a red-haired female, and the special-projects sisters Ya, Trice, and Damu, new from the
        breeding division.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> When she let the gloves have their way, she was freer than she had ever felt
        before. Control was somewhere uncentered, behind her eyes and beyond her fingers, as if she were drawn on a
        beautiful silver wire where it was best to go. Doing what was best to do. She barely saw the field that flowed
        from the grip of the thick, solid gloves or felt its caressing, life-sustaining influence. Truly, she hardly saw
        or felt anything but situations, targets, opportunities, the success or failure of the Zap. Failure was an acute
        pain. She was never reprimanded for failure; the reprimand was in her blood, and she felt as if she wanted to
        die. But then the opportunity would improve, the Zap would succeed, and everything around her—stars, Senexi
        seedship, the Mellangee, everything—seemed part of a beautiful dream all her own.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> She was intense in the Mocks.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> Their initial practice over, the entry play began.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> One by one, the special-projects sisters took their hyperbolic formation.
        Their glove fields threw out extensions, and they combined force. In they went, the mock Senexi seedship
        brilliant red and white and UV and radio and hateful before them. Their tails swept through the seedship's outer
        shields and swirled like long silky hair laid on water; they absorbed fantastic energies, grew bright like
        violent little stars against the seedship outline. They were engaged in the drawing of the shields, and sure as
        topology, the spirals of force had to have a dimple on the opposite side that would iris wide enough to let in
        glovers. The sisters twisted the forces and Prufrax could see the dimple stretching out under them.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> The exercise ended. The elfstate glovers were cast into sudden dark. Prufrax
        came out of the mock unprepared, her mind still bent on the Zap. The lack of orientation drove her as mad as a
        moth suddenly flipped from night to day. She careened until gently mitted and Channeled. She flowed down a tube,
        the field slowly neutralizing, and came to a halt still gloved, her body jerking and tingling.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "What the breed happened?" she screamed, her hands beginning to hurt.</span>
    </p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "Energy conserve," a mechanical voice answered, Behind Prufrax the other
        elfstate glovers lined up in the catch tube, all but the special-projects sisters. Ya, Trice, and Damu had been
        taken out of the exercise early and replaced by simulations. There was no way their functions could be mocked.
        They entered the tube ungloved and helped their comrades adjust to the overness of the real.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> As they left the mock chamber, another batch of glovers, even younger and
        fresher in elfstate, passed them. Ya held her hands up, and they saluted in return. "Breed more every day,"
        Prufrax grumbled. She worried about having so many crew she'd never be able to conduct a satisfactory Zap
        herself. Where would the honor of being a glover go if everyone was a glover?</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> She wriggled into her cramped bunk, feeling exhilarated and irritated. She
        replayed the mocks and added in the missing Zap, then stared gloomily at her small narrow feet.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> Out there the Senexi waited. Perhaps they were in the same state as
        she—ready to fight, testy at being reined in. She pondered her ignorance, her inability to judge whether such
        things were even possible among the enemy. She thought of the researcher, Clevo. "Blank," she murmured. "Blank,
        blank." Such thoughts were unnecessary, and humanizing Senexi was unworthy of a glover.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> </span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> Aryz looked at the instrument, stretched a pod into it, and willed. Vocal
        human language came out the other end, thin and squeaky in the helium atmosphere. The sound disgusted and
        thrilled him. He removed the instrument from the gelatinous strands of the engineering wall and pushed it into
        his interior through a stretched permeum. He took a thick draft of ammonia and slid to the human-shapes chamber
        again.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> He pushed through the narrow port into the observation room. Adjusting his
        eyes to the heat and bright light beyond the transparent wall, he saw the round mutated shape first—the result
        of their unsuccessful experiments. He swung his sphere around and looked at the others.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> For a time he couldn't decide which was uglier—the mutated shape or the
        normals. Then he thought of what it would be like to have humans tamper with Senexi and try to make them into
        human forms. . . . He looked at the round human and shrank as if from sudden heat. Aryz had had nothing to do
        with the experiments. For that, at least, he was grateful.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> Aryz placed the tip of the vocalizer against a sound-transmitting plate and
        spoke.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "Hello," came the sound within the chamber. The mutated shape looked up. It
        lay on the floor, great bloated stomach backed by four almost useless pods. It usually made high-pitched sounds
        continuously. Now it stopped and listened, straining on the tube that connected it to the breed-supervising
        device.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "Hello," replied the male. It sat on a ledge across the chamber, having
        unhooked itself.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> The machine that served as surrogate parent and instructor stood in one
        corner, an awkward parody of a human, with limbs too long and head too small. Aryz could see the unwillingness
        of the designing engineers to examine human anatomy too closely.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "I am called—" Aryz said, his name emerging as a meaningless stretch of
        white noise. He would have to do better than that. He compressed and adapted the frequencies. "I am called
        Aryz."</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "Hello," the young female said.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "What are your names?" He knew them well enough, having listened many times
        to their conversations.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "Prufrax," the female said. "I'm a glover."</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> The human shapes contained very little genetic memory. As a kind of brood
        marker, Aryz supposed, they had been equipped with their name, occupation, and the rudiments of environmental
        knowledge.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "I'm a teacher, Prufrax," Aryz said.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "I don't understand you," the female replied.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "You teach me, I teach you."</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "We have the Mam," the male said, pointing to the machine. "She teaches us."
        The Mam, as they called it, was hooked into the mandate.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "Do you know where you are?" Aryz asked.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "Where we live," Prufrax said. "Eyes-open."</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "Don't talk to it," the male said. "Mam talks to us," Aryz consulted the
        mandate for some understanding of the name they had given to the breed-supervising machine. Mam, it explained,
        was probably a natural expression for womb-carrying parent. Aryz severed the machine's power.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "Mam is no longer functional," he said. He would have the engineering wall
        put together another less identifiable machine to link them to the mandate and to their nutrition. He wanted
        them to associate comfort and completeness with nothing but himself.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> The machine slumped, and the female shape pulled herself free of the hookup.
        She started to cry, a reaction quite mysterious to Aryz. His link with the mandate had not been intimate enough
        to answer questions about the wailing and moisture from the eyes. After a time the male and female lay down and
        became dormant.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> The mutated shape made more soft sounds and tried to approach the
        transparent wall. It held up its thin arms as if beseeching. The others would have nothing to do with it; now it
        wished to go with him. Perhaps the biologists had partially succeeded in their attempt at transformation;
        perhaps it was more Senexi than human.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> Aryz quickly backed out through the port, into the cool and security of the
        corridor beyond.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> </span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> It was an endless orbital dance, this detection and matching of course,
        moving away and swinging back, deceiving and revealing, between the Mellangee and the Senexi seedship.</span>
    </p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> Filled with her skill and knowledge, Prufrax waited, feeling like a ripe
        fruit about to fall from the tree. At this point in their training, just before the application, elfstates were
        most receptive. She was allowed to take a lover, and they were assigned small separate quarters near the outer
        greenroads.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> The contact was satisfactory, as far as it went. Her mate was an older
        glover named Kumnax, and as they lay back in the cubicle, soothed by air-dance fibs, he told her stories about
        past battles, special tactics, how to survive.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "Survive?" she asked, puzzled.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "Of course." His long brown face was intent on the view of the greenroads
        through the cubicle's small window.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "I don't understand," she said.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "Most glovers don't make it," he said patiently.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "I will."</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> He turned to her. "You're six," he said. "You're very young. I'm ten. I've
        seen. You're about to be applied for the first time, you're full of confidence. But most glovers won't make it.
        They breed thousands of us. We're expendable. We're based on the best glovers of the past but even the best
        don't survive."</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "I will," Prufrax repeated, her jaw set.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "You always say that," he murmured.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> Prufrax stared at him for a moment.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "Last time I knew you," he said, "you kept saying that. And here you are,
        fresh again."</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "What last time?"</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "Master Kumnax," a mechanical voice interrupted.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> He stood, looking down at her. "We glovers always have big mouths. They
        don't like us knowing, but once we know, what can they do about it?"</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "You are in violation," the voice said. "Please report to S." "But now, if
        you last, you'll know more than the tellman tells."</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "I don't understand," Prufrax said slowly, precisely, looking him straight
        in the eye.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "I've paid my debt," Kumnax said. "We glovers stick. Now I'm going to go get
        my punishment." He left the cubicle. Prufrax didn't see him again before her first application.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> </span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> The seedship buried itself in a heating protostar, raising shields against
        the infalling ice and stone. The nebula had congealed out of a particularly rich cluster of exploded fourth-and
        fifth-generation stars, thick with planets, the detritus of which now fell on Aryz's ship like hail.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> Aryz had never been so isolated. No other branch mind addressed him; he never
        even saw them now. He made his reports to the brood mind, but even there the reception was warmer and warmer,
        until he could barely endure to communicate. Consequently—and he realized this was part of the plan —he came
        closer to his charges, the human shapes.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> The brood mind was interested in one question: how successfully could they
        be planted aboard a human ship? Would they be accepted until they could carry out their sabotage, or would they
        be detected? Already Senexi instructions were being coded into their teachings.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "I think they will be accepted in the confusion of an engagement," Aryz
        answered. He had long since guessed the general outlines of the brood mind's plans. Communication with the human
        shapes was for one purpose only, to use them as decoys, insurgents. They were weapons. Knowledge of human
        activity and behavior was not an end in itself; seeing what was happening to him, Aryz fully understood why the
        brood mind wanted such study to proceed no further.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> He would lose them soon, he thought, and his work would be over. He would be
        much too human-tainted. He would end, and his replacement would start a new existence, very little different
        from Aryz's—but, he reasoned, adjusted. The replacement would not have Aryz's peculiarity.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> He approached his last meeting with the brood mind, preparing himself for
        his final work, for the ending. In the cold liquid-filled chamber, the great red-and-white sac waited, the
        center of his team, his existence. He adored it. There was no way he could criticize its action.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> Yet--</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "We are being sought," the brood mind radiated. "Are the shapes
        ready?"</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "Yes," Aryz said. "The new teaching is firm. They believe they are fully
        human." And, except for the new teaching, they were. "They defy sometimes." He said nothing about the mutated
        shape. It would not be used. If they won this encounter, it would probably be placed with Aryz's body in a
        fusion torch for complete purging.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "Then prepare them," the brood mind said. "They will be delivered to the
        vector for positioning and transfer."</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> </span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> Darkness and waiting. Prufrax nested in her delivery tube like a freshly
        chambered round. Through her gloves she caught distant communications murmurs that resembled voices down hollow
        pipes. The Mellangee was coming to full readiness.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> Huge as her ship was, Prufrax knew that it would be dwarfed by the seedship.
        She could recall some hazy details about the seedship's structure, but most of that information was stored
        securely away from interference by her conscious mind.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> More information would be fed to her just before the launch, but she knew
        the general procedure. The seedship was deep in a protostar, hiding behind the distortion of geometry and the
        complete hash of electromagnetic energy. The Mellangee would approach, collide if need be. Penetrate. Release.
        Find. Zap. Her fingers ached. Sometime before the launch she would also be fed her final moans—the temaers—and
        she would be primed to leave elfstate. She would be a mature glover. She would be a woman.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> If she returned</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> will return.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> Her fingers ached worse.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> The tempers came, moans tiding in, then the battle data. As it passed into
        her subconscious, she caught a flash of</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> Rocks and ice, a thick cloud of dust and gas glowing red but seeming dark,
        no stars, no constellation guides this time. The beacon came on. That would be her only way to orient once the
        gloves stopped inertial and locked onto the target.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> The seedship</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> was like</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> a shadow within a shadow</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> twenty-two kilometers across, yet</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> Data: The Mellangee has buried herself in the seedship, plowed deep into the
        interior like a carnivore's muzzle looking for vitals</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> Instruction a swarm of seeks is dashing through the seed-ship, looking for
        the brood minds, for the brood chambers, for branch minds. The glovers will follow.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> Prufrax sees herself clearly now. She is the great avenging comet, bringer
        of omen and doom, like a knife moving through the glass and ice and thin, cold helium as if they weren't there,
        the chambered round fired and tearing at hundreds of kilometers an hour through the Senexi vessel, following the
        seeks.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> The seedship cannot withdraw into higher geometries now. It is pinned by the
        Mellangee. It is hers.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> Information floods her, pleases her immensely. She swoops down
        orange-and-gray corridors, buffeting against the walls like a ricocheting bullet. Almost immediately she comes
        across a branch mind, sliding through the ammonia film against the outrushing wind, trying to reach an armored
        cubicle. Her first Zap is too easy, not satisfying, nothing like what she thought. In her wake the branch mind
        becomes scattered globules of plasma. She plunges deeper.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> Aryz delivers his human charges to the vectors that will launch them. They
        are equipped with simulations of the human weapons, their hands encased in the hideous gray gloves.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> The seedship is in deadly peril; the battle has almost been lost at one
        stroke. The seedship cannot remain whole. It must self-destruct, taking the human ship with it, leaving only a
        fragment with as many teams as can escape.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> The vectors launch the human shapes. Aryz tries to determine which part of
        the ship will be elected to survive; he must not be there. His job is over, and he must die.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> The glovers fan out through the seedship's central hollow, demolishing the
        great cold drive engines, bypassing the shielded fusion flare and the reprocessing plant, destroying machinery
        built before their Earth was formed.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> The special-projects sisters take the lead. Suddenly they are confused. They
        have found a brood mind, but it is not heavily protected. They surround it, prepare for the Zap--</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> It is sacrificing itself, drawing them into an easy kill and away from
        another portion of the seedship. Power is concentrating elsewhere. Sensing that, they kill quickly and move
        on.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> Aryz's brood mind prepares for escape. It begins to wrap itself in flux bind
        as it moves through the ship toward the frozen fragment. Already three of its five branch minds are dead; it can
        feel other brood minds dying. Aryz's bud replacement has been killed as well.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> Following Aryz's training, the human shapes rush into corridors away from
        the main action. The special-projects sisters encounter the decoy male, allow it to fly with them ... until it
        aims its weapons. One Zap almost takes out Trice. The others fire on the shape immediately. He goes to his death
        weeping, confused from the very moment of his launch.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> The fragment in which the brood mind will take refuge encompasses the
        chamber where the humans had been nurtured, where the mandate is still stored. All the other brood minds are
        dead, Aryz realizes; the humans have swept down on them so quickly. What shall he do?</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> Somewhere, far off, he feels the distressed pulse of another branch mind
        dying. He probes the remains of the seedship. He is the last. He cannot dissipate now; he must ensure the brood
        mind's survival.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> Prufrax, darting through the crumbling seedship, searching for more
        opportunities, comes across an injured glover. She calls for a mediseek and pushes on.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> The brood mind settles into the fragment. Its support system is damaged; it
        is entering the time-isolated state, the flux bind, more rapidly than it should. The seals of foamed electric
        ice cannot quite close off the fragment before Ya, Trice, and Damu slip in. They frantically call for bind
        cutters and preservers; they have instructions to capture the last brood mind, if possible.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> But a trap falls upon Ya, and snarling fields tear her from her gloves. She
        is flung down a dark distintegrating shaft, red cracks opening all around as the seedship's integrity fails. She
        trails silver dust and freezes, hits a barricade, shatters.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> The ice seals continue to close. Trice is caught between them and pushes out
        frantically, blundering into the region of the intensifying flux bind. Her gloves break into hard bits, and she
        is melded into an ice wall like an insect trapped on the surface of a winter lake.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> Damu sees that the brood mind is entering the final phase of flux bind.
        After that they will not be able to touch it. She begins a desperate Zap.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> and is too late.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> Aryz directs the subsidiary energy of the flux against her. Her Zap deflects
        from the bind region, she is caught in an interference pattern and vibrates until her tiniest particles stop
        their knotted whirlpool spins and she simply becomes space and searing light.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> The brood mind, however, has been damaged. It is losing information from one
        portion of its anatomy. Desperate for storage, it looks for places to hold the information before the flux
        bind's last wave.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> Aryz directs an interface onto the brood mind's surface. The silvery pools
        of time binding flicker around them both. The brood mind's damaged sections transfer their data into the last
        available storage device—the human mandate.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> Now it contains both human and Senexi information.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> The silvery pools unite, and Aryz backs away. No longer can he sense the
        brood mind. It is out of reach but not yet safe. He must propel the fragment from the remains of the seedship.
        Then he must wrap the fragment in its own flux bind, cocoon it in physics to protect it from the last ravages of
        the humans.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> Aryz carefully navigates his way through the few remaining corridors. The
        helium atmosphere has almost completely dissipated, even there. He strains to remember all the procedures. Soon
        the seedship will explode, destroying the human ship. By then they must be gone.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> Angry red, Prufrax follows his barely sensed form, watching him behind
        barricades of ice, approaching the moment of a most satisfying Zap. She gives her gloves their way and finds a
        shape behind her, wearing gloves that are not gloves, not like her own, but capable of grasping her in tensed
        fields, blocking the Zap, dragging them together. The fragment separates, heat pours in from the protostar
        cloud. They are swirled in their vortex of power, twin locked comets—one red, one sullen gray.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "Who are you?" Prufrax screams as they close in on each other in the fields.
        Their environments meld. They grapple. In the confusion, the darkening, they are drawn out of the cloud with the
        fragment, and she sees the other's face.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> Her own.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> The seedship self-destructs. The fragment is propelled from the protostar,
        above the plane of what will become planets in their orbits, away from the crippled and dying Mellangee.</span>
    </p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> Desperate, Prufrax uses all her strength to drill into the fragment. Helium
        blows past them, and bits of dead branch minds.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> Aryz catches the pair immediately in the shapes chamber, rearranging the
        fragment's structure to enclose them with the mutant shape and mandate. For the moment he has time enough to
        concentrate on them. They are dangerous. They are almost equal to each other, but his shape is weakening faster
        than the true glover. They float, bouncing from wall to wall in the chamber, forcing the mutant to crawl into a
        corner and howl with fear.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> There may be value in saving the one and capturing the other. Involved as
        they are, the two can be carefully dissected from their fields and induced into a crude kind of sleep before the
        glover has a chance to free her weapons. He can dispose of the gloves—fake and real—and hook them both to the
        Mam, reattach the mutant shape as well. Perhaps something can be learned from the failure of the
        experiment.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> The dissection and capture occur faster than the planning. His movement
        slows under the spreading flux bind. His last action, after attaching the humans to the Mam, is to make sure the
        brood mind's flux bind is properly nested within that of the ship.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> The fragment drops into simpler geometries.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> It is as if they never existed.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> </span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> The battle was over. There were no victors. Aryz became aware of the passage
        of time, shook away the sluggishness, and crawled through painfully dry corridors to set the environmental
        equipment going again. Throughout the fragment, machines struggled back to activity.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> How many generations? The constellations were unrecognizable. He made star
        traces and found familiar spectra and types, but advanced in age. There had been a malfunction in the overall
        flux bind. He couldn't find the nebula where the battle had occurred. In its place were comfortably middle-aged
        stars surrounded by young planets.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> Aryz came down from the makeshift observatory. He slid through the fragment,
        established the limits of his new home, and found the solid mirror surface of the brood mind's cocoon. It was
        still locked in flux bind, and he knew of no way to free it. In time the bind would probably wear off—but that
        might require life spans. The seedship was gone. They had lost the brood chamber, and with it the stock.</span>
    </p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> He was the last branch mind of his team. Not that it mattered now; there was
        nothing he could initiate without a brood mind. If the flux bind was permanent, then he might as well be
        dead.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> He closed his thoughts around him and was almost completely submerged when
        he sensed an alarm from the shapes chamber. The interface with the mandate had turned itself off; the new
        version of the Mam was malfunctioning. He tried to repair the equipment, but without the engineer's wall he was
        almost helpless. The best he could do was rig a temporary nutrition supply through the old human-form Mam. When
        he was done, he looked at the captive and the two shapes, then at the legless, armless Mam that served as their
        link to the interface and life itself.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> </span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> She had spent her whole life in a room barely eight by ten meters, and not
        much taller than her own height. With her had been Grayd and the silent round creature whose name—if it had
        any—they had never learned. For a time there had been Mam, then another kind of Mam not nearly as satisfactory.
        She was hardly aware that her entire existence had been miserable, cramped, in one way or another
        incomplete.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> Separated from them by a transparent partition, another round shape had
        periodically made itself known by voice or gesture.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> Grayd had kept her sane. They had engaged in conspiracy. Removing themselves
        from the interface—what she called "eyes-shut"—they had held onto each other, tried to make sense out of what
        they knew instinctively, what was fed them through the interface, and what the being beyond the partition told
        them.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> First, they knew their names, and they knew that they were glovers. They
        knew that glovers were fighters. When Aryz passed instruction through the interface on how to fight, they had
        accepted it eagerly but uneasily. It didn't seem to jibe with instructions locked deep within their
        instincts.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> Five years under such conditions had made her introspective. She expected
        nothing, sought little beyond experience in the eyes-shut. Eyes-open with Grayd seemed scarcely more than a
        dream. They usually managed to ignore the peculiar round creature in the chamber with them; it spent nearly all
        its time hooked to the mandate and the Mam.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> Of one thing only was she completely sure. Her name was Prufrax. She said it
        in eyes-open and eyes-shut, her only certainty.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> Not long before the battle, she had been in a condition resembling dreamless
        sleep, like a robot being given instructions. The part of Prufrax that had taken on personality during eyes-shut
        and eyes-open for five years had been superseded by the fight instructions Aryz had programmed. She had flown as
        glovers must fly (though the gloves didn't seem quite right).</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> She had fought, grappling (she thought), with herself, but who could be
        certain of anything?</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> She had long since decided that reality was not to be sought too avidly.
        After the battle she fell back into the mandate—into eyes-shut—all too willingly.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> But a change had come to eyes-shut, too. Before the battle, the information
        had been selected. Now she could wander through the mandate at will. She seemed to smell the new information,
        completely unfamiliar, like a whiff of ocean. She hardly knew where to begin. She stumbled across:</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> —that all vessels carry one, no matter what their size or class, just as
        every individual carries the map of a species. The mandate shall contain all the information of our kind,
        including accurate, and uncensored history, for if we have learned anything, it is that censored and untrue
        accounts distort the eyes of the leaders. Unders are told lies. Leaders must seek and be provided with accounts
        as accurate as possible, or we will be weakened and fall.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> What wonderful dreams the leaders must have had. And they possessed some
        intrinsic gift called truth, through the use of the mandate. Prufrax could hardly believe that. As she made her
        tentative explorations through the new fields of eyes-shut, she began to link the word mandate with what she
        experienced. That was where she was.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> And she was alone. Once, she had explored with Grayd. Now there was no sign
        of Grayd.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> She learned quickly. Soon she walked along a beach on Earth, then a beach on
        a world called Myriadne, and other beaches, fading in and out. By running through the entries rapidly, she came
        up with a blurred eidos and so learned what a beach was in the abstract. It was a boundary between one kind of
        eyes-shut and another, between water and land, neither of which had any corollary in eyes-open.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> Some beaches had sand. Some had clouds—the eidos of clouds was quite
        attractive. And one had herself running scared, screaming.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> She called out, but the figure vanished. Prufrax stood on a beach under a
        greenish-yellow star, on a world called Kyrene, feeling lonelier than ever.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> She explored further, hoping to find Grayd, if not the figure that looked
        like herself. Grayd wouldn't flee from her. Grayd would…</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> The round thing confronted her, its helpless limbs twitching. Now it was her
        turn to run, terrified. Never before had she met the round creature in eyes-shut. It was mobile; it had a
        purpose. Over land, clouds, trees, rocks, wind, air, equations, and an edge of physics she fled. The farther she
        went, the more distant from the round one with hands and small head, the less afraid she was.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> She never found Grayd.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> </span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> The memory of the battle was fresh and painful. She remembered the ache of
        her hands, clumsily removed from the gloves. Her environment had collapsed and been replaced by something
        indistinct. Prufrax had fallen into a deep slumber and had dreamed.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> The dreams were totally unfamiliar to her. If there was a left-turning in
        her arc of sleep, she dreamed of philosophies and languages and other things she couldn't relate to. A
        right-turning led to histories and sciences so incomprehensible as to be nightmares.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> It was a most unpleasant sleep, and she was not at all sorry to find she
        wasn't really asleep.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> The crucial moment came when she discovered how to slow her turnings and the
        changes of dream subject. She entered a pleasant place of which she had no knowledge but which did not seem
        threatening. There was a vast expanse of water, but it didn't terrify her. She couldn't even identify it as
        water until she scooped up a handful. Beyond the water was a floor of shifting particles. Above both was an open
        expanse, not black but obviously space, drawing her eyes into intense pale blue-green. And there was that figure
        she had encountered in the seedship. Herself. The figure pursued. She fled.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> Right over the boundary into Senexi information. She knew then that what she
        was seeing couldn't possibly come from within herself. She was receiving data from another source. Perhaps she
        had been taken captive. It was possible she was now being forcibly debriefed. The tellman had discussed such
        possibilities, but none of the glovers had been taught how to defend themselves in specific situations. Instead
        it had been stated—in terms that brooked no second thought—that self-destruction was the only answer. So she
        tried to kill herself.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> She sat in the freezing cold of a red-and-white room, her feet meeting but
        not touching a fluid covering on the floor. The information didn't fit her senses; it seemed blurred,
        inappropriate. Unlike the other data, this didn't allow participation or motion. Everything was locked
        solid.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> She couldn't find an effective means of killing herself. She resolved to
        close her eyes and simply will herself into dissolution. But closing her eyes only moved her into a deeper or
        shallower level of deception—other categories, subjects, visions. She couldn't sleep, wasn't tired, couldn't
        die.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> Like a leaf on a stream, she drifted. Her thoughts untangled, and she
        imagined herself floating on the water called ocean. She kept her eyes open. It was quite by accident that she
        encountered:</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> A voice with different tone immediately took over.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> Ah, now that's quite a story. I was her biographer, the organizer of her

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> —Why, she's me ... sort of.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> She's us.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> </span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> She stood two and a half meters tall. Her hair was black and thick, though
        cut short; her limbs well muscled though drawn out by the training and hormonal treatments. She was seventeen
        years old, one of the few birds born in the solar system, and for the time being she had a chip on her shoulder.
        Everywhere she went, the birds asked about her mother, Jayax. "You better than her?"</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> Of course not! Who could be? But she was good; the instructors said so. She
        was just about through training, and whether she graduated to hawk or remained bird she would do her job well.
        Asking Prufrax about her mother was likely to make her set her mouth tight and glare.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> On Mercior, the Grounds took up four thousand hectares and had its own port.
        The Grounds was divided into Land, Space, and Thought, and training in each area was mandatory for fledges,
        those birds embarking on hawk training. Prufrax was fledge three. She had passed Land—though she loathed
        downbound fighting—and was two years into Space. The tough part, everyone said, was not passing Space, but
        lasting through four years of Thought after the action in nearorbit and planetary.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> The Zap! She's talking the Zap!</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> —What's that?</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> —You're me, you should know.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> —I'm not you, and we're not her.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> The Zap, said the mandate, and the data shifted.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "Tomorrow you receive your first implants. These will allow you to
        coordinate with the zero-angle phase engines and find your targets much more rapidly than you ever could with
        simple biologic. Are there any questions?"</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "Yes, sir." Prufrax stood at the top of the spherical classroom, causing the
        hawk instructor to swivel his platform. "I'm having problems with the zero-angle phase maths. Reduction of the
        momenta of the real."</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> Other fledge threes piped up that they, too, had had trouble with those
        maths. The hawk instructor sighed. "We don't want to install cheaters in all of you. It's bad enough needing
        implants to supplement biologic. Individual learning is much more desirable. Do you request cheaters?" That was
        a challenge. They all responded negatively, but Prufrax had a secret smile. She knew the subject. She just took
        delight in having the maths explained again. She could reinforce an already thorough understanding. Others not
        so well versed would benefit. She wasn't wasting time. She was in the pleasure of her weapon—the weapon she
        would be using against the Senexi.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "Zero-angle phase is the temporary reduction of the momenta of the real."
        Equations and plexes appeared before each student as the instructor went on. "Nested unreals can conflict if a
        barrier is placed between the participator princip and the assumption of the real. The effectiveness of the
        participator can be determined by a convenience model we call the angle of phase. Zero-angle phase is achieved
        by an opaque probability field according to modified Fourier of the separation of real waves. This can also be
        caused by the reflection of the beam —an effective counter to zero-angle phase, since the beam is always
        compoundable and the compound is always time-reversed. Here are the true gedanks—"</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> —The Senexi? They're Senexi.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> —I think ... eyes-open is the world of the Senexi. What does that
        mean?</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> —That we're prisoners. You were caught before me. —Oh.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> The news came as she was in recovery from the implant. Seedships had
        violated human space again, dropping cuckoos on thirty-five worlds. The worlds had been young colonies, and the
        cuckoos had wiped out all life, then tried to reseed with Senexi forms. The overs had reacted by sterilizing the
        planets' surfaces. No victory, loss to both sides. It was as if the Senexi were so malevolent they didn't care
        about success, only about destruction.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> She hated them. She could imagine nothing worse.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> Prufrax was twenty-three. In a year she would be qualified to hawk on a
        cruiser/raider. She would demonstrate her hatred.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> Aryz felt himself slipping into endthought, the mind set that always
        preceded a branch find's self-destruction. What was there for him to do? The fragment had survived, but atwhat
        cost, to what purpose? Nothing had been accomplished. The nebula had been lost, or he supposed it had. He would
        likely never know the actual outcome.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> He felt a vague irritation at the lack of a spectrum of responses. Without a
        purpose, a branch find was nothing more than excess plasm.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> He looked in on the captive and the shapes, all hooked to the mandate, and
        wondered what he would do with them. How would humans react to the situation he was in? More vigorously,
        probably. They would fight on. They always had. Even without leaders, with no discernible purpose, even in
        defeat. What gave them such stamina? Were they superior, more deserving? If they were better, then was it right
        for the Senexi to oppose their triumph?</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> Aryz drew himself tall and rigid with confusion. He had studied them too
        long. They had truly infected him. But here at least was a hint of purpose. A question needed to be
        answered.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> He made preparations. There were signs the brood mind's flux bind was not
        permanent, was in fact unwinding quite rapidly. When it emerged, Aryz would present it with a judgment, an
        answer.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> He realized, none too clearly, that by Senexi standards he was now a raving
        lunatic.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> He would hook himself into the mandate, improve the somewhat isolating
        interface he had used previously to search for selected answers. He, the captive, and the shapes would be
        immersed in human history together. They would be like young suckling on a Population I mother-animal—just the
        opposite of the Senexi process, where young fed nourishment and information into the brood mind.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> The mandate would nourish, or poison. Or both.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> </span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> —Did she love?</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> —What—you mean, did she receive? </span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> —No, did she—we—I—give? </span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> —I don't know what you mean.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> —I wonder if she would know what I mean... .</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> Love, said the mandate, and the data proceeded.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> Prufrax was twenty-nine. She had been assigned to a cruiser in a new program
        where superior but untested fighters were put into thick action with no preliminary.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> The Cruiser was a million-ton raider, with a hawk contingent of fifty-three
        and eighty regular crew. She would be used in a secondwave attack, following the initial hardfought.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> She was scared. That was good; fright improved basic biologic, if properly
        managed. The cruiser would make a raid into Senexi space and retaliate for past cuckoo-seeding programs. They
        would come up against thornships and seedships, probably.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> The fighting was going to be fierce.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> The raider made its final denial of the overness of the real and pipsqueezed
        into an arduous, nasty sponge space. It drew itself together again and emerged far above the galactic
        plane.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> Prufrax sat in the hawks wardroom and looked at the simulated rotating
        snowball of stars. Red-coded numerals flashed along the borders of known Senexi territory, signifying where they
        had first come to power when the terrestrial sun had been a mist-wrapped youngster. A green arrow showed the
        position of the raider.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> She drank sponge-space supplements with the others but felt isolated because
        of her firstness, her fear. Everyone seemed so calm. Most were fours or fives—on their fourth or fifth battle
        call. There were ten ones and an upper scatter of experienced hawks with nine to twenty-five battles behind
        them. There were no thirties. Thirties were rare in combat; the few that survived so many engagements were
        plucked off active and retired to PR service under the polinstructors. They often ended up in fibs, acting
        poorly, looking unhappy.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> Still, when she had been more naive, Prufrax's heron had been a
        man-and-woman thirty team she had watched in fib after fib—Kumnax and Arol..They had been better actors than
        most.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> Day in, day out, they drilled in their fightsuits. While the crew bustled,
        hawks were put through implant learning, what slang was already calling the Know, as opposed to the Tell, of
        classroom teaching. Getting background, just enough to tickle her curiosity, not enough to stimulate morbid
        interest.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> —There it is again. Feel?</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> —I know it. Yes. The round one, part of eyes-open .. .</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> —Senexi?—No, brother without name.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> —Your . . . brother?</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> —No . . . I don't know.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> Still, there were items of information she had never received before, items
        privileged only to the fighters, to assist them in their work. Older hawks talked about the past, when data had
        been freely available. Stories circulated in the wardroom about the Senexi, and she managed to piece together
        something of their origins and growth.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> Senexi worlds, according to a twenty, had originally been large, cold masses
        of gas circling bright young suns nearly metal-free. Their gas-giant planets had orbited the suns at hundreds of
        millions of kilometers and had been dusted by the shrouds of neighboring dead stars; the essential elements
        carbon, nitrogen, silicon, and fluorine had gathered in sufficient quantities on some of the planets to allow
        Population II biology.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> In cold ammonia seas, lipids had combined in complex chains. A primal kind
        of life had arisen and flourished. Across millions of years, early Senexi forms had evolved. Compared with
        evolution on Earth, the process at first had moved quite rapidly. The mechanisms of procreation and evolution
        had been complex in action, simple in chemistry.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> There had been no competition between life forms of different genetic bases.
        On Earth, much time had been spent selecting between the plethora of possible ways to pass on genetic
        knowledge.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> And among the early Senexi, outside of predation there had been no death.
        Death had come about much later, self-imposed for social reasons. Huge colonies of protoplasmic individuals had
        gradually resolved into the team-forms now familiar.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> Soon information was transferred through the budding of branch minds;
        cultures quickly developed to protect the integrity of larvae, to allow them to regroup and form a new brood
        mind. Technologies had been limited to the rare heavy materials available, but the Senexi had expanded for a
        time with very little technology. They were well adapted to their environment, with few predators and no need to
        hunt, absorbing stray nutrients from the atmosphere and from layers of liquid ammonia. With perceptions attuned
        to the radio and microwave frequencies, they had before long turned groups of branch minds into radio telescope
        chains, piercing the heavy atmosphere and probing the universe in great detail, especially the very active
        center of the young galaxy. Huge jets of matter, streaming from other galaxies and emitting high-energy
        radiation, had provided laboratories for their vicarious observations. Physics was a primitive science to
        them.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> Since little or no knowledge was lost in breeding cycles, cultural growth
        was rapid at times; since the dead weight of knowledge was often heavy, cultural growth often slowed to a
        crawl.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> Using water as a building material, developing techniques that humans still
        understood imperfectly, they prepared for travel away from their birthworlds.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> Prufrax wondered, as she listened to the older hawks, how humans had come to
        know all this. Had Senexi been captured and questioned? Was it all theory? Did anyone really know—anyone she
        could ask?</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> —She's weak.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> —Why weak?</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> —Some knowledge is best for glovers to ignore. Some questions are best left
        to the supreme overs.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> —Have you thought that in here, you can answer her questions, our
        questions?</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> —No. No. Learn about me—us—first.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> In the hour before engagement, Prufrax tried to find a place alone. On the
        raider, this wasn't difficult. The ship's size was overwhelming for the number of hawks and crew aboard. There
        were many areas where she could put on an environs and walk or drift in silence, surrounded by the dark shapes
        of equipment wrapped in plexerv.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> She pulled herself through the cold Gless tunnels, feeling slightly awed by
        the loneness, the quiet. One tunnel angled outboard, toward the hull of the cruiser. She hesitated, peering into
        its length with her environs beacon, when a beep warned her she was near another crew member. She was startled
        to think someone else might be as curious as she. She scooted expertly up the tunnel, spreading her arms and
        tucking her legs as she would in a fightsuit.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> The tunnel was filled with a faint milky green mist, absorbing her environs
        beam. It couldn't be much more than a couple of hundred meters long, however, and it was quite straight. The
        signal beeped louder.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> Ahead she could make out a dismantled weapons blister. That explained the
        fog: a plexery aerosol diffused in the low pressure. Sitting in the blister was a man, his environs glowing a
        pale violet. He had deopaqued a section of the blister and was staring out at the stars. He swiveled as she
        approached and looked her over dispassionately. He seemed to be a hawk—he had fightform, tall, thin with brown
        hair above hull-white skin, large eyes with pupils so dark she might have been looking through his head into
        space beyond.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "Under," she said as their environs met and merged.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "Over. What are you doing here?"</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "I was about to ask you the same."</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "You should be getting ready for the fight," he admonished.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "I am. I need to be alone for a while."</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "Yes." He turned back to the stars. "I used to do that, too." "You don't
        fight now?"</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> He shook his head. "Retired. I'm a researcher."</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> She tried not to look impressed. Crossing rates was almost impossible. A
        bitalent was unusual in the service.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "What kind of research?" she asked.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "I'm here to correlate enemy finds."</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "Won't find much of anything, after we've done with the zero phase."</span>
    </p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> It would have been polite for him to say, "Power to that," or offer some
        other encouragement. He said nothing. "Why would you want to research them?"</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "To fight an enemy properly, you have to know what they are. Ignorance is
        defeat."</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "You research tactics?"</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "Not exactly."</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "What, then?"</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "You'll be in tough hardfought this wake. Make you a proposition. You fight
        well, observe, come to me, and tell me what you see. Then I'll answer your questions."</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "Brief you before my immediate overs?"</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "I have the authority," he said. No one had ever lied to her; she didn't
        even suspect he would. "You're eager?"</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "Very."</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "You'll be doing what?"</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "Engaging Senexi fighters, then hunting down branch minds and brood
        minds."</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "How many fighters going in?"</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "Twelve."</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "Big target, eh?"</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> She nodded.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "While you're there, ask yourself—what are they fighting for?
        Understand?"</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "Ask, what are they fighting for. Just that. Then come back to me."</span>
    </p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "What's your name?"</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "Not important," he said. "Now go."</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> She returned to the prep center as the sponge-space warning tones began.
        Overhawks went among the fighters in the lineup, checking gear and giveaway body points for mental orientation.
        Prufrax submitted to the molded sensor mask being slipped over her face. "Ready!" the overhawk said.
        "Hardfought!" He clapped her on the shoulder. "Good luck."</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "Thank you, sir." She bent down and slid into her fightsuit. Along the
        launch line, eleven other hawks did the same. The overs and other crew left the chamber, and twelve red beams
        delineated the launch tube. The fightsuits automatically lifted and aligned on their individual beams. Fields
        swirled around them like silvery tissue in moving water, then settled and hardened into cold-scintillating
        walls, pulsing as the launch energy built up.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> The tactic came to her. The ship's sensors became part of her information
        net. She saw the Senexi thornship—twelve kilometers in diameter, cuckoos lacing its outer hull like maggots on
        red fruit, snakes waiting to,take them on.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> She was terrified and exultant, so worked up that her body temperature was
        climbing. The fightsuit adjusted her balance.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> At the count of ten and nine, she switched from biologic to cyber. The
        implant—after absorbing much of her thought processes for weeks—became Prufrax.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> For a time there seemed to be two of her. Biologic continued, and in that
        region she could even relax a bit, as if watching a fib.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> With almost dreamlike slowness, in the electronic time ofcyber, her
        fightsuit followed the beam. She saw the stars and oriented herself to the cruiser's beacon, using both for
        reference, plunging in the sword-flower formation to assault the thornship. The cuckoos retreated in the vast
        red hull like worms withdrawing into an apple. Then hundreds of tiny black pinpoints appeared in the quadrant
        closest to the sword flower.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> </span><span class="none">Snakes shot out, each piloted by a Senexi branch
        ind. "Hardfought!" she told herself in biologic before that portion gave over completely to cyber.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> —Why were we flung out of dark through ice and fire, a shower of sparks? a
        puzzle;</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> —Perhaps to build hell.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> —We strike here, there;</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> —Set brief glows, fall through and cross round again.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> —By our dimming, we see what Beatitude we have. In the circle, kindling
        together, we form an exhausted Empyrean. We feel the rush of igniting winds but still grow dull and wan.</span>
    </p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> —New rage flames, new light, dropping like sun through muddy ice and night
        and fall</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> —Close, spinning blue and bright.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> —In time they, too, Tire. Redden.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> —We join, compare pasts cool in huddled paths, turn gray.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> —And again.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> —We are a companion flow of ash, in the slurry, out and down.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> —We sleep.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> —Rivers form above and below. Above, iron snakes twist, clang and slice,
        chime, helium eyes watching, seeing Snowflake hawks, signaling adamant muscles and energy teeth. What hunger
        compels our venom spit?</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> —It flies, strikes the crystal flight, making mist gray-green with ammonia
        rain.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> —Sleeping we glide, and to each side unseen shores wait with the moans of an
        unseen tide.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> </span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> —She wrote that. We. One of her—our—poems. —Poem?</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> —A kind of fib, I think.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> —I don't see what it says.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> —Sure you do! She's talking hardfought.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> —Do you understand it?</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> —Not at all .. .</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> She lay back in the bunk, legs crossed, eyes closed, feeling the receding
        dominance of the implant—the overness of cyber—and the almost pleasant ache in her back. She had survived her
        first. The thornship had retired, severely damaged, its surface seared and scored so heavily it would never
        release cuckoos again.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> It would become a hulk, a decoy. Out of action. Satisfaction/out of
        action/Satisfaction ...</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> Still, with eight of the twelve fighters lost, she didn't quitefeel the
        exuberance of the rhyme. The snakes had fought very well. Bravely, she might say. They lured, sacrificed,
        cooperated, demonstrating teamwork as fine as that in her own group. Strategy was what made the cruiser's raid
        successful. A superior approach, an excellent tactic. And perhaps even surprise, though the final analysis
        hadn't been posted yet.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> Without those advantages, they might have all died.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> She opened her eyes and stared at the pattern of blinking lights in the
        ceiling panel, lights with their secret codes that repeated every second, so that whenever she looked at them,
        the implant deep inside was debriefed, reinstructed. Only when she fought would she know what she was now
        seeing.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> She returned to the tunnel as quickly as she was able. She floated up toward
        the blister and found him there, surrounded by packs of information from the last hardfought. She waited until
        he turned his attention to her.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "Well?" he said.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "I asked myself what they are fighting for. And I'm very angry."</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "Why?"</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "Because I don't know. I can't know. They're Senexi." "Did they fight
        well?"</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "We lost eight. Eight." She cleared her throat.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "Did they fight well?" he repeated, an edge to his voice. "Better than I was
        ever told they could."</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "Did they die?"</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "Enough of them."</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "How many did you kill?"</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "I don't know." But she did. Eight.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "You killed eight," he said, pointing to the packs. "I'm analyzing the
        battle now."</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "You're behind what we read, what gets posted?" she asked.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "Partly," he said. "You're a good hawk."</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "I knew I would be," she said, her tone quiet, simple. "Since they fought
        bravely—"</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "How can Senexi be brave?" she asked sharply.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "Since," he repeated, "they fought bravely, why?" "They want to live, to do
        their . . . work. Just like me." "No," he said. She was confused, moving between extremes in her mind, first
        resisting, then giving in too much. "They're Senexi. They're not like us."</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "What's your name?" she asked, dodging the issue. "Clevo."</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> Her glory hadn't even begun yet, and already she was well into her
        fall.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> </span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> Aryz made his connection and felt the brood mind's emergency cache of
        knowledge in the mandate grow up around him like ice crystals on glass. He stood in a static scene. The
        transition from living memory to human machine memory had resulted in either a coding of data or a reduction of
        detail; either way, the memory was cold, not dynamic. It would have to be compared, recorrelated, if that would
        ever be possible.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> How much human data had had to be dumped to make space for this?</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> He cautiously advanced into the human memory, calling up topics almost at
        random.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> He backed away from sociological data, trying to remain within physics and
        mathematics. There he could make conversions to fit his understanding without too much strain.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> Then something unexpected happened. He felt the brush of another mind, a
        gentle inquiry from a source made even stranger by the hint of familiarity. It made what passed for a Senexi
        greeting, but not in the proper form, using what one branch mind of a team would radiate to a fellow; a gross
        breach, since it was obviously not from his team or even from his family. Aryz tried to withdraw. How was it
        possible for minds to meet in the mandate? As he retreated, he pushed into a broad region of incomprehensible
        data. It had none of the characteristics of the other human regions he had examined.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> —This is for machines, the other said. —Not all cultural data are limited to
        biologic. You are in the area where programs and cyber designs are stored. They are really accessible only to a
        machine hooked into the mandate.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> —What is your family? Aryz asked, the first step-question in the sequence
        Senexi used for urgent identity requests.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> —I have no family. I am not a branch mind. No access to active brood minds. I
        have learned from the mandate.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> —Then what are you?</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> —I don't know, exactly. Not unlike you.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> It was the mind of the mutated shape, the one that had remained in the
        chamber, beseeching when he approached the transparent barrier.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> —I must go now, the shape said. Aryz was alone again in the incomprehensible
        jumble. He moved slowly, carefully, into the Senexi sector, calling up subjects familiar to him. If he could
        encounter one shape, doubtless he could encounter the others—perhaps even the captive.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> The idea was dreadful—and fascinating. So far as he knew, such intimacy
        between Senexi and human had never happened before. Yet there was something very Senexi-like in the method, as
        if branch minds attached to the brood mind were to brush mentalities while searching in the ageless
        memories.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> The dread subsided. There was little worse that could happen to him, with
        his fellows dead, his brood mind in flux bind, his purpose uncertain.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> What Aryz was feeling, for the first time, was a small measure of
        freedom.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> </span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> The story of the original Prufrax continued.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> In the early stages she visited Clevo with a barely concealed anger. His
        method was aggravating, his goals never precisely spelled out. What did he want with her, if anything?</span>
    </p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> And she with him? Their meetings were clandestine, though not precisely
        forbidden. She was a hawk one now with considerable personal liberty between exercises and engagements. There
        were no monitors in the closed-off reaches of the cruiser, and they could do whatever they wished. The two met
        in areas close to the ship's hull, usually in weapons blisters that could be opened to reveal the stars; there
        they talked.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> Prufrax was not accustomed to prolonged conversation. Hawks were neither
        raised to be voluble, nor selected for their curiosity. Yet the exhawk Clevo talked a great deal and was the
        most curious person she had met, herself included, and she regarded herself as uncharacteristically
        curious.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> Often he was infuriating, especially when he played the "leading game," as
        she called it. Leading her from one question to the next, like an instructor, but without the trappings or any
        clarity of purpose. "What do you think of your mother?"</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "Does that matter?"</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "Not to me."</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "Then why ask?"</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "Because you matter."</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> Prufrax shrugged. "She was a fine mother. She bore me with a well-chosen
        heritage. She raised me as a hawk candidate. She told me her stories."</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "Any hawk I know would envy you for listening at Jayax's knee."</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "I was hardly at her knee."</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "A speech tactic."</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "Yes, well, she was important to me."</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "She was a preferred single?"</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "Yes."</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "So you have no father?"</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "She selected without reference to individuals."</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "Then you are really not that much different from a Senexi."</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> She bristled and started to push away. "There! You insult me again."</span>
    </p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "Not at all. I've been asking one question all this time, and you haven't
        even heard. How well do you know the enemy?"</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "Well enough to destroy them." She couldn't believe that was the only
        question he'd been asking. His speech tactics were very odd.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "Yes, to win battles, perhaps. But who will win the war?"</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "It'll be a long war," she said softly, floating a few meters from him. He
        rotated in the blister, blocking out a blurred string of stars. The cruiser was preparing to shift out of status
        geometry again. "They fight well."</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "They fight with conviction. Do you believe them to be evil?"</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "They destroy us."</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "We destroy them."</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "So the question," she said, smiling at her cleverness, "is who began to
        destroy?"</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "Not at all," Clevo said. "I suspect there's no longer a clear answer to
        that. We are the new, they are the old. The old must be superseded."</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "That's the only way we're different? They're old, we're not so old? I don't
        understand."</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "Nor do I, entirely.""Well, finally!"</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "The Senexi," Clevo continued, unperturbed, "long ago needed only gas-giant
        planets like their homeworlds. They lived in peace for billions of years before our world was formed. But as
        they moved from star to star, they learned uses for other types of worlds. We were most interested in rocky
        Earth-like planets. Gradually we found uses for gas giants, too. By the time we met, each of us encroached on
        the other's territory. Their technology is so improbable, so unlike ours, that when we first encountered them we
        thought they must come from another geometry."</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "Where did you learn all this?" Prufrax squinted at him suspiciously.</span>
    </p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "I'm no longer a hawk," he said, "but I was too valuable just to discard. My
        experience was too broad, my abilities too useful. So I was placed in research. It seems a safe place for me.
        Little contact with my comrades." He looked directly at her. "We must try to know our enemy, at least a
        little."</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "That's dangerous," Prufrax said, almost instinctively.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "Yes, it is. What you know, you cannot hate."</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "We must hate," she said. "It makes us strong. Senexi hate."</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "They might," he said. "But, sometime, wouldn't you like to . . . sit down
        and talk with one, after a battle? Talk with a fighter? Learn its tactic, how it bested you in one move,
        compare—"</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "No!" Prufrax shoved off rapidly down the tube. "We're shifting now. We have
        to get ready."</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> —She's smart. She's leaving him. He's crazy.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> —Why do you think that?</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> —He would stop the fight, end the Zap.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> —But he was a hawk.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> —And hawks became glovers, I guess. But glovers go wrong, too. Like
        you.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> —Did you know they used you? How you were used? —That's all blurred
        now.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> —She's doomed if she stays around him. Who's that? –Someone is listening
        with us.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> The next battle was bad enough to fall into the hellfought. Prufrax was in
        her fightsuit, legs drawn up as if about to kick off. The cruiser exited sponge space and plunged into combat
        before sponge space supplements could reach full effectiveness. She was dizzy, disoriented. The overhawks could
        only hope that a switch from biologic to cyber would cure the problem.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> She didn't know what they were attacking. Tactic was flooding the implant,
        but she was only receiving the wash of that; she hadn't merged yet. She sensed that things were confused. That
        bothered her. Overs did not feel confusion.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> The cruiser was taking damage. She could sense at least that, and she wanted
        to scream in frustration. Then she was ordered to merge with the implant. Biologic became cyber. She was in the
        Know.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> The cruiser had reintegrated above a gas-giant planet. They were
        seventy-nine thousand kilometers from the upper atmosphere. The damage had come from ice mines—chunks of
        Senexi-treated water ice, altered to stay in sponge space until a human vessel integrated near by. Then they
        emerged, packed with momentum and all the residual instability of an unsuccessful return to status geometry.
        Unsuccessful for a ship, that is—very successful for a weapon.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> The ice mines had given up the overness of the real within range of the
        cruiser and had blasted out whole sections of the hull. The launch lanes had not been damaged. The fighters
        lined up on their beams and were peppered out into space, spreading in the famous sword flower.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> The planet was a cold nest. Over didn't know what the atmosphere contained,
        but Senexi activity had been high in the star system, concentrating on this world. Over had decided to take a
        chance. Fighters headed for the atmosphere. The cruiser began planting singularity eggs. The eggs went ahead of
        the fighters, great black grainy ovoids that seemed to leave a trail of shadow—the wake of a birthing disruption
        in status geometry that could turn a gas giant into a short-lived sun.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> Their time was limited. The fighters would group on entry sleds and descend
        to the liquid water regions where Senexi commonly kept their upwelling power plants. The fighters would first
        destroy any plants, loop into the liquid ammoniaregions to search for hidden cuckoos, then see what was so
        important about the world.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> She and five other fighters mounted the sled. Growing closer, the hazy clear
        regions of the atmosphere sparked with Senexi sensors. Spiderweb beams shot from the six sleds to down the
        sensors. Buffet began. Scream, heat, then a second flower from the sled at a depth of two hundred kilometers.
        The sled slowed and held station. It would be their only way back. The fightsuits couldn't pull out of such a
        large gravity well.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> She descended deeper. The pale, bloated beacon of the red star was drooping
        below the second cloudtops, limning the strata in orange and purple. At the liquid ammonia level she was
        instructed to key in permanent memory of all she was seeing. She wasn't "seeing" much, but other sensors were
        recording a great deal, all of it duly processed in her implant. "There's life here," she told herself.
        Indigenous life. Just another example of Senexi disregard for basic decency: they were interfering with a world
        developing its own complex biology.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> The temperature rose to ammonia vapor levels, then to liquid water. The
        pressure on the fightsuit was enormous, and she was draining her stores much more rapidly than expected. At this
        level the atmosphere was particularly thick with organics.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> Senexi snakes rose from below, passed them in altitude, then doubled back to
        engage. Prufrax was designated the deep diver; the others from her sled would stay at this level in her defense.
        As she fell, another sled group moved in behind her to double the cover.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> She searched for the characteristic radiation curve of an upwelling plant.
        At the lower boundary of the liquid water level, below which her suit could not safely descend, she found
        it.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> The Senexi were tapping the gas giant's convection from greater depths than
        usual. Above the plant, almost indetectable, was another object with an uncharacteristic curve. They were
        separated by ten kilometers. The power plant was feeding its higher companion with tight energy beams.</span>
    </p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> She slowed. Two other fighters, disengaged from the brief skirmish above,
        took positions as backups a few dozen kilometers higher than she. Her implant searched for an appropriate
        tactic. She would avoid the zero-angle phase for the moment, go in for reconnaissance. She could feel sound
        pouring from the plant and its companion—rhythmic, not waste noise, but deliberate. And homing in on that sound
        were waves of large vermiform organisms, like chains of gas-filled sausage. They were dozens of meters long, two
        meters at their greatest thickness, shaped vaguely like the Senexi snake fighters. The vermiforms were native,
        and they were being lured into the uppermost floating structure. None were merging. Her backups spread apart,
        descended, and drew up along her flanks.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> She made her decision almost immediately. She could see a pattern in the
        approach of the natives. If she fell into the pattern, she might be able to enter the structure
        unnoticed.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> —It's a grinder. She doesn't recognize it.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> What's a grinder?</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> She should make the Zap! It's an ugly thing; Senexi use them all the time.
        Net a planet with grinders, like a cuckoo, but for larger operations.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> The creatures were being passed through separator fields. Their organics
        fell from the bottom of the construct, raw material for new growth—Senexi growth. Their heavier elements were
        stored for later harvest.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> With Prufrax in their midst, the vermiforms flew into the separator. The
        interior was hundreds of meters wide, lead-white walls with flat gray machinery floating in a dust haze, full of
        hollow noise, the distant bleats of vermiforms being slaughtered. Prufrax tried to retreat, but she was caught
        in a selector field. Her suit bucked and she was whirled violently, then thrown into a repository for
        examination. She had been screened from the separator; her plan to record, then destroy, the structure had been
        foiled by an automatic filter.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "Information sufficient." Command logic programmed into the implant before
        launch was now taking over. "Zero-angle phase both plant and adjunct." She was drifting in the repository, still
        slightly stunned. Something was fading. Cyber was hissing in and out; the over logic-commands were being
        scrambled. Her implant was malfunctioning and was returning control to biologic. The selector fields had played
        havoc with all cyber functions, down to the processors in her weapons.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> Cautiously she examined the down systems one by one, determining what she
        could and could not do. This took as much as thirty seconds—an astronomical time on the implant's scale.</span>
    </p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> She still could use the phase weapon. If she was judicious and didn't waste
        her power, she could cut her way out of the repository, maneuver and work with her escorts to destroy both the
        plant and the separator. By the time they returned to the sleds, her implant might have rerouted itself and made
        sufficient repairs to handle defense. She had no way of knowing what was waiting for her if—when—she escaped,
        but that was the least of her concerns for the moment.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> She tightened the setting of the phase beam and swung her fightsuit around,
        knocking a cluster of junk ice and silty phosphorescent dust. She activated the beam. When she had a hole large
        enough to pass through, she edged the suit forward, beamed through more walls and obstacles, and kicked herself
        out of the repository into free fall. She swiveled and laid down a pattern of wide-angle beams, at the same time
        relaying a message on her situation to the escorts.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> The escorts were not in sight. The separator was beginning to break up,
        spraying debris through the almost opaque atmosphere. The rhythmic sound ceased, and the crowds of vermiforms
        began to disperse.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> She stopped her fall and thrust herself several kilometers higher—directly
        into a formation of Senexi snakes. She had barely enough power to reach the sled, much less fight and turn her
        beams on the upwelling plant.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> Her cyber was still down.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> The sled signal was weak. She had no time to calculate its direction from
        the inertial guidance cyber. Besides, all cyber was unreliable after passing through the separator.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> Why do they fight so well? Clevo's question clogged her thoughts. Cursing,
        she tried to blank and keep all her faculties available for running the fightsuit. When evenly matched, you
        cannot win against your enemies unless you understand them. And if you truly understand, why are you fighting
        and not talking? Clevo had never told her that—not in so many words. But it was part of a string of logic all
        her own.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> Be more than an automaton with a narrow range of choices. Never
        underestimate the enemy. Those were old</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> Grounds dicta, not entirely lost in the new training, but only emphasized by
        Clevo.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> If they fight as well as you, perhaps in some ways they fight-think like you
        do. Use that.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> Isolated, with her power draining rapidly, she had no choice. They might
        disregard her if she posed no danger. She cut her thrust and went into a diving spin. Clearly she was on her way
        to a high-pressure grave. They would sense her power levels, perhaps even pick up the lack of field activity if
        she let her shields drop. She dropped the shields. If they let her fall and didn't try to complete the kill—if
        they concentrated on active fighters above—she had enough power to drop into the water vapor regions, far below
        the plant, and silently ride a thermal into range. With luck, she could get close enough to lay a web of
        zero-angle phase and take out the plant.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> She had minutes in which to agonize over her plan. Falling, buffeted by
        winds that could knock her kilometers out of range, she spun like a vagrant flake of snow.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> She couldn't even expend the energy to learn if they were scanning her,
        checking out her potential.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> Perhaps she underestimated them. Perhaps they would be that much more
        thorough and take her out just to be sure. Perhaps they had unwritten rules of conduct like the ones she was
        using, taking hunches into account. Hunches were discouraged in Grounds training—much less reliable than
        cyber.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> She fell. Temperature increased. Pressure on her suit began to constrict her
        air supply. She used fighter trancing to cut back on her breathing.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> Fell.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> And broke the trance. Pushed through the dense smoke of exhaustion. Planned
        the beam web. Counted her reserves. Nudged into an updraft beneath the plant. The thermal earned her, a silent
        piece of paper in a storm, drifting back and forth beneath the objective. The huge field intakes pulsed above,
        lightning outlining their invisible extension. She held back on the beam.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> Nearly faded out. Her suit interior was almost unbearably hot.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> She was only vaguely aware of laying down the pattern. The beams vanished in
        the murk. The thermal pushed her through a layer of haze, and she saw the plant, riding highabove clear
        atmosphere turbulence. The zero-angle phase had pushed through the field intakes, into their source nodes and
        the plant body, surrounding it with bright blue Tcherenkov. First, the surface began to break up, then the
        middle layers, and finally key supports. Chunks vibrated away with the internal fury of their molecular, then
        atomic, then particle disruption. Paraphrasing Grounds description of beam action, the plant became less and
        less convinced of its reality. "Matter dreams," an instructor had said a decade before. "Dreams it is real,
        maintains the dream by shifting rules with constant results. Disturb the dreams, the shifting of the rules
        results in inconstant results. Things cannot hold."</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> She slid away from the updraft, found another, wondered idly how far she
        would be lifted. Curiosity at the last. Let's just see, she told herself; a final experiment.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> Now she was cold. The implant was flickering, showing signs of
        reorganization. She didn't use it. No sense expanding the amount of time until death. No sense at all.</span>
    </p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> The sled, maneuvered by one remaining fighter, glided up beneath her almost
        unnoticed.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> </span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> Aryz waited in the stillness of a Senexi memory, his thinking temporarily
        reduced to a faint susurrus. What he waited for was not clear.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> Come.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> The form of address was wrong, but he recognized the voice. His thoughts
        stirred, and he followed the nebulous presence out of Senexi territory.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> —Know your enemy.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> Prufrax . . . the name of one of the human shapes sent out against their own
        kind. He could sense her presence in the mandate, locked into a memory store. He touched on the store and caught
        the essentials—the grinder, the updraft plant, the fight from Prufrax's viewpoint.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> Know how your enemy knows you.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> He sensed a second presence, similar to that of Prufax. It took him some
        time to realize that the human captive was another form of the shape, a reproduction of the .. .</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> Both were reproductions of the female whose image was in the memory store.
        Aryz was not impressed by threes—Senexi</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> mysticism, what had ever existed of it, had been preoccupied with fives and
        sixes—but the coincidence was striking. —Know how your enemy sees you.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> He saw the grinder processing organics—the vermiform natives—in preparation
        for a widespread seeding of deuterium gatherers. The operation had evidently been conducted for some time; the
        vermiform populations were greatly reduced from their usual numbers. Vermiforms were a common type-species on
        gas giants of the sort depicted. The mutated shape nudged him into a particular channel of the memory, that
        which carried the original Prufrax's emotions. She had reacted with disgust to the Senexi procedure. It was a
        reaction not unlike what Aryz might feel when coming across something forbidden in Senexi behaviour. Yet
        eradication was perfectly natural, analogous to the human cleansing of food before eating.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> —It's in the memory. The vermiforms are intelligent. They have their own
        kind of civilization. Human action on this world prevented their complete extinction by the Senexi.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> —So what matter they were intelligent? Aryz responded. They did not behave
        or think like Senexi, or like any species Senexi find compatible. They were therefore not desirable. Like
        humans.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> —You would make humans extinct?</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> —We would protect ourselves from them.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> —Who damages the other most?</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> Aryz didn't respond. The line of questioning was incomprehensible. Instead
        he flowed into the memory of Prufrax, propelled by another aspect of complete freedom, confusion.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> </span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> The implant was replaced. Prufrax's damaged limbs and skin were repaired or
        regenerated quickly, and within four wakes, under intense treatment usually reserved only for overs, she
        regained all her reflexes and speed. She requested liberty of the cruiser while it returned for repairs. Her
        request was granted.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> She first sought Clevo in the designated research area. He wasn't there, but
        a message was, passed on to her by a smiling young crew member. She read it quickly:</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "You're free and out of action. Study for a while, then come find me. The old
        place hasn't been damaged. It's less private, but still good. Study! I've marked highlights."</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> She frowned at the message, then handed it to the crew member, who duly
        erased it and returned to his duties. She wanted to talk with Clevo, not study.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> But she followed his instructions. She searched out high-lighted entries in
        the ship's memory store. It was not nearly as dull as she had expected. In fact, by following the highlights,
        she felt she was learning more about Clevo and about the questions he asked.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> Old literature was not nearly as graphic as fibs, but it was different
        enough to involve her for a time. She tried to create imitations of what she read but erased them. Nonfib
        stories were harder than she suspected. She read about punishment, duty; she read about places called heaven and
        hell, from a writer who had died tens of thousands of years before. With ed supplement guidance, she was able to
        comprehend most of what she read. Plugging the store into her implant, she was able to absorb hundreds of
        volumes in an hour.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> Some of the stores were losing definition. They hadn't been used in decades,
        perhaps centuries.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> Halfway through, she grew impatient. She left the research area. Operating
        on another hunch, she didn't go to the blister as directed, but straight to memory central, two decks inboard
        the research area. She saw Clevo there, plugged into a data pillar, deep in some aspect of ship history. He
        noticed her approach, unplugged, and swiveled on his chair. "Congratulations," he said, smiling at her.</span>
    </p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "Hardfought," she acknowledged, smiling.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "Better than that, perhaps," he said.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> She looked at him quizzically. "What do you mean, better?"</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "I've been doing some illicit tapping on over channels." "So?"</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> —He is dangerous!</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "For what?"</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "You may have a valuable genetic assortment. Overs think you behaved
        remarkably well under impossible conditions." "Did I?"</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> He nodded. "Your type may be preserved."</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "Which means?"</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "There's a program being planned. They want to take the best fighters and
        reproduce them—clone them—to make uniform top-grade squadrons. It was rumored in my time—you haven't
        heard?"</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> She shook her head.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "It's not new. It's been done, off and on, for tens of thousands of years.
        This time they believe they can make it work."</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "You were a fighter, once," she said. "Did they preserve your type?"</span>
    </p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> Clevo nodded. "I had something that interested them, but not, I think, as a
        fighter."</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> Prufrax looked down at her stubby-fingered hands. "It was grim," she said.
        "You know what we found?"</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "An extermination plant."</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "You want me to understand them better. Well, I can't. I refuse. How could
        they do such things?" She looked disgusted and answered her own question. "Because they're Senexi."</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "Humans," Clevo said, "have done much the same, sometimes worse."</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "No!"</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> —No!</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "Yes," he said firmly. He sighed. "We've wiped Senexi</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> worlds, and we've even wiped worlds with intelligent species</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> like our own. Nobody is innocent. Not in this universe." "We were never
        taught that."</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "It wouldn't have made you a better hawk. But it might make a better human
        of you to know. Greater depth of character. Do you want to be more aware?"</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "You mean, study more?"</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> He nodded.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "What makes you think you can teach me?"</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "Because you thought about what I asked you. About how Senexi thought. And
        you survived where some other hawk might not have. The overs think it's in your genes. It might be. But it's
        also in your head."</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "Why not tell the overs?"</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "I have," he said. He shrugged.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "They wouldn't want me to learn from you?"</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "I don't know," Clevo said. "I suppose they're aware you're talking to me.
        They could stop it if they wanted." "And if I learn from you?"</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "Not from me, actually. From the past. From history, what other people have
        thought. I'm really not any more capable than you . . . but I know history, small portions of it. I won't teach
        you so much as guide."</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "I did use your questions," Prufrax said. "But will I ever need to use
        them—think that way—again?"</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> Clevo nodded. "Of course."</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> You're quiet.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> —She's giving in to him.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> She gave in a long time ago.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> —She should be afraid.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> —Were you—we—ever really afraid of a challenge?</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> No.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> —Not Senexi, not forbidden knowledge.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> Clevo first led her through the history of past wars, judging that was
        appropriate considering her occupation. She was attentive enough, though her mind wandered; sometimes he was
        didactic, but she found she didn't mind that much.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> She saw that in all wars, the first stage was to dehumanize the enemy,
        reduce the enemy to a lower level so that he might be killed without compunction. When the enemy was not human
        to begin with, the task was easier. As wars progressed, this tactic frequently led to an underestimation of the
        enemy, with disastrous consequences. "We aren't exactly underestimating the Senexi," Clevo said. "The overs are
        too smart for that. But we refuse to understand them, and that could make the war last indefinitely."</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "Then why don't the overs see that?"</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "Because we're being locked into a pattern. We've been fighting for so long,
        we've begun to lose ourselves. And itN getting worse." He assumed his didactic tone, and she knew he was
        reciting something he'd formulated years before and repeated to himself a thousand times. "There is no war so
        important that, to win it, we must destroy our minds."</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> She didn't agree with that; losing the war with the Senexi would mean
        extinction, as she understood things.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> Most often they met in the single unused weapons blister that had not been
        damaged. They met when the ship was basking in the real between sponge-space jaunts. He brought memory stores
        with him in portable modules, and they read, listened, experienced together. She never placed a great deal of
        importance in the things she learned; her interest was focused on Clevo. Still, she learned.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> The rest of her time she spent training. She was aware of a growing
        isolation from the hawks, which she attributed to her uncertain rank status. Was her genotype going to be
        preserved or not? The decision hadn't been made. The more she learned, the less she wanted to be singled out for
        honor. Attracting that sort of attention might be dangerous, she thought. Dangerous to whom, or what, she could
        not say.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> Clevo showed her how hero images had been used to indoctrinate birds and
        hawks in a standard of behavior that was ideal, not realistic. The results were not always good; some tragic
        blunders had been made by fighters trying to be more than anyone possibly could or refusing to be
        flexible.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> The war was certainly not a fib. Yet more and more the overs seemed to be
        treating it as one. Unable to bring about strategic victories against the Senexi, the overs had settled in for a
        long war of attrition and were apparently bent on adapting all human societies to the effort.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "There are overs we never hear of, who make decisions that shape our entire
        lives. Soon they'll determine whether or not we're even born, if they don't already."</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "That sounds paranoid," she said, trying out a new word and concept she had
        only recently learned.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "Maybe so."</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "Besides, it's been like that for ages—not knowing all our overs."</span>
    </p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "But it's getting worse," Clevo said. He showed her the projections he had
        made. In time, if trends continued unchanged, fighters and all other combatants would be treated more and more
        mechanically, until they became the machines the overs wished them to be.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> —No.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> —Quiet. How does he feel toward her?</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> It was inevitable that as she learned under his tutelage, he began to feel
        responsible for her changes. She was an excellent fighter. He could never be sure that what he was doing might
        reduce her effectiveness. And yet he had fought well—despite similar changes—until his billet switch. It had
        been the overs who had decided he would be more effective, less disruptive, elsewhere.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> Bitterness over that decision was part of his motive. The overs had done a
        foolish thing, putting a fighter into research. Fighters were tenacious. If the truth were to be hidden, then
        fighters would be the ones likely to ferret it out. And pass it on. There was a code among fighters, seldom
        revealed to their immediate overs, much less to the supreme overs parsecs distant in their strategospheres. What
        one fighter learned that could be of help to another had to be passed on, even under penalty. Clevo was simply
        following that unwritten rule.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> Passing on the fact that, at one time, things had been different. That war
        changed people, governments, societies, and that societies could effect an enormous change on their
        constituents, especially now—change in their lives, their thinking. Things could become even more structured.
        Freedom of fight was a drug, an illusion-</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> No! used to perpetuate a state of hatred.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "Then why do they keep all the data in stores?" she asked. "I mean, you
        study the data, everything becomes obvious."</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "There are still important people who think we may want to find our way back
        someday. They're afraid we'll lose our roots, but—" His face suddenly became peaceful. She reached out to touch
        him, and he jerked slightly, turning toward her in the blister. "What is it?" she asked.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "It's not organized. We're going to lose the information. Ship overs are
        going to restrict access more and more. Eventually it'll decay, like some already has in these stores. I've been
        planning for some time to put it all in a single unit—"</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> —He built the mandate!</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "and have the overs place one on every ship, with researchers to tend it.
        Formalize the loose scheme still in effect, but dying. Right now I'm working on the fringes. At least I'm
        allowed to work. But soon I'll have enough evidence that they won't be able to argue. Evidence of what happens
        to societies that try to obscure their histories. They go quite mad. The overs are still rational enough to
        listen; maybe I'll push it through." He looked out the transparent blister. The stars were smudging to one side
        as the cruiser began probing for entrances to sponge space. "We'd better get back."</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "Where are you going to be when we return? We'll all be transferred."</span>
    </p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "That's some time removed. Why do you want to know?" "I'd like to learn
        more."</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> He smiled. "That's not your only reason."</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "I don't need someone to tell me what my reasons are," she said
        testily.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "We're so reluctant," he said. She looked at him sharply, irritated and
        puzzled. "I mean," he continued, "we're hawks. Comrades. Hawks couple like that." He snapped his fingers. "But
        you and I sneak around it all the time."</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> Prufrax kept her face blank.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "Aren't you receptive toward me?" he asked, his tone almost teasing.</span>
    </p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "It's just that that's not all," she said, her tone softening. "Indeed," he
        said in a barely audible whisper.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> In the distance they heard the alarms.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> —It was never any different.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> —What?</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> —Things were never any different before me.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> —Don't be silly. It's all here.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> —If Clevo made the mandate, then he put it here. It isn't true.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> —Why are you upset?</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> —I don't like hearing that everything I believe is a . . . fib.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> —I've never known the difference, I suppose. Eyes-open was never all that
        real to me. This isn't real, you aren't ... this is eyes-shut. So why be upset? You and I . . . we aren't even
        whole people. I feel you. You wish the Zap, you fight, not much else. I'm just a shadow, even compared to you.
        But she is whole. She loves him. She's less a victim than either of us. So something has to have changed.</span>
    </p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> —You're saying things have gotten worse.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> —If the mandate is a lie, that's all I am. You refuse to accept. I have to
        accept, or I'm even less than a shadow. —I don't refuse to accept. It's just hard.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> —You started it. You thought about love.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> —You did!</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> —Do you know what love is?</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> —Reception.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> They first made love in the weapons blister. It came as no surprise; if
        anything, they approached it so cautiously they were clumsy. She had become more and more receptive, and he had
        dropped his guard. It had been quick, almost frantic, far from the orchestrated and drawn-out ballet the hawks
        prided themselves for. There was no pretense. No need to play the roles of artists back once more into the past,
        through the dim gray millennia of repeating ages. History began to manifest again, differences in the
        record.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> </span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> On the way back to Mercior, four skirmishes were fought. Prufrax did well in
        each. She carried something special with her, a thought she didn't even tell Clevo, and she carried the same
        thought with her through their last days at the Grounds.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> Taking advantage of hawk liberty, she opted for a posthardfought residence
        just outside the Grounds, in the relatively uncrowded Daughter of Cities zone. She wouldn't be returning to
        fight until several issues had been decided—her status most important among them.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> Clevo began making his appeal to the middle overs. He was given Grounds duty
        to finish his proposals. They could stay together for the time being.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> The residence was sixteen square meters in area, not elegant—natural, as
        rentOpts described it.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> On the last day she lay in the crook of Clevo's arm. They had done a few
        hours of nature sleep. He hadn't come out yet, and she looked up at his face, reached up with a hand to feel his
        arm.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> It was different from the arms of others she had been receptive toward. It
        was unique. The thought amused her. There had never been a reception like theirs. This was the beginning. And if
        both were to be duplicated, this love, this reception, would be repeated an infinite number of times. Clevo
        meeting Prufrax, teaching her, opening her eyes.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> Somehow, even though repetition contributed to the death of history, she was
        pleased. This was the secret thought she carried into fight. Each time she would survive, wherever she was,
        however many duplications down the line. She would receive Clevo, and he would teach her. If not now—if one or
        the other died—then in the future. The death of history might be a good thing. Love could go on forever.</span>
    </p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> She had lost even a rudimentary apprehension of death, even with present
        pleasure to live for. Her functions had sharpened. She would please him by doing all the things he</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> could not. And if he was to enter that state she frequently found him in,
        that state of introspection, of reliving his own battles and of envying her activity, then that wasn't bad. All
        they did to each other was good.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> —Was good</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> —Was</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> She slipped from his arm and left the narrow sleeping quarter, pushing
        through the smoke-colored air curtain to the lounge. Two hawks and an over she had never seen before .were
        sitting there. They looked up at her.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "Under," Prufrax said.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "Over," the woman returned. She was dressed in tan and green, Grounds
        colors, not ship.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "May I assist?"</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "Yes."</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "My duty, then?"</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> The over beckoned her closer. "You have been receiving a researcher."</span>
    </p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "Yes," Prufrax said. The meetings could not have been a secret on the ship,
        and certainly not their quartering near the Grounds. "Has that been against duty?"</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "No." The over eyed Prufrax sharply, observing her perfected fightform, the
        easy grace with which she stood, naked, in the middle of the small compartment. "But a decision has been
        reached. Your status is decided now."</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> She felt a shiver.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "Prufrax," said the elder hawk. She recognized him from fibs, and his
        companion: Kumnax and Arol. Once her heroes. "You have been accorded an honor, just as your partner has. You
        have a valuable genetic assortment—"</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> She barely heard the rest. They told her she would return to fight, until
        they deemed she had had enough experience and background to be brought into the polinstruc division. Then her
        fighting would be over. She would serve better as an example, a hero.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> Heroes never partnered out of function. Hawk heroes could not even partner
        with exhawks.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> Clevo emerged from the air curtain. "Duty," the over said. "The residence is
        disbanded. Both of you will have separate quarters, separate duties."</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> They left. Prufrax held out her hand, but Clevo didn't take it. "No use," he
        said.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> Suddenly she was filled with anger. "You'll give it up? Did I expect too
        much? How strongly?"</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "Perhaps even more strongly than you," he said. "I knew the order was coming
        down. And still I didn't leave. That may hurt my chances with the supreme overs."</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "Then at least I'm worth more than your breeding history?" "Now you are
        history. History the way they make it." "I feel like I'm dying," she said, amazement in her voice.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "What is that, Clevo? What did you do to me?"</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "I'm in pain, too," he said.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "You're hurt?"</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "I'm confused."</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "I don't believe that," she said, her anger rising again. "You knew, and you
        didn't do anything?"</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "That would have been counter to duty. We'll be worse off if we fight
        it."</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "So what good is your great, exalted history?"</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "History is what you have," Clevo said. "I only record." —Why did they
        separate them?</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> —I don't know. You didn't like him, anyway.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> —Yes, but now.. .</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> —I don't understand.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> —We don't. Look what happens to her. They took what was best out of her.
        Prufrax went into battle eighteen more times before dying as heroes often do, dying in the midst of what she did
        best. The question of what made her better before the separation—for she definitely was not as fine a fighter
        after—' has not been settled. Answers fall into an extinct classification of knowledge, and there are few left
        to interpret, none accessible to this device.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> —So she went out and fought and died. They never even made fibs about her.
        This killed her?</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> —I don't think so. She fought well enough. She died like other hawks
        died.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> —And she might have lived otherwise.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> —How can I know that, any more than you? —They—we—met again, you know. I met
        a Clevo once, on my ship. They didn't let me stay with him long.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> —How did you react to him?</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> —There was so little time, I don't know.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> —Let's ask... .</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> In thousands of duty stations, it was inevitable that some of Prufrax's
        visions would come true, that they should meet now and then. Clevos were numerous, as were Prufraxes. Every ship
        carried complements of several of each. Though Prufrax was never quite as successful as the original, she was a
        fine type. She-</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> —She was never quite as successful. They took away her edge. They didn't
        even know it!</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> —They must have known.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> —Then they didn't want to win!</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> —We don't know that. Maybe there were more important considerations.</span>
    </p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> —Yes, like killing history.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> </span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> Aryz shuddered in his warming body, dizzy as if about to bud, then regained
        control. He had been pulled from the mandate, called to his own duty.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> He examined the shapes and the human captive. There was something different
        about them. How long had they been immersed in the mandate? He checked quickly, frantically, before answering
        the call. The reconstructed Mam had malfunctioned. None of them had been nourished. They were thin, pale,
        cooling.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> Even the bloated mutant shape was dying; lost, like the others, in the
        mandate.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> He turned his attention way. Everything was confusion. Was he human or
        Senexi now? Had he fallen so low as to understand them? He went to the origin of the call, the ruins of the
        temporary brood chamber. The corridors were caked with ammonia ice, burning his pod as he slipped over them. The
        brood mind had come out of flux bind. The emergency support systems hadn't worked well; the brood mind was
        damaged.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "Where have you been?" it asked.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "I assumed I would not be needed until your return from the flux
        bind."</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "You have not been watching!"</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "Was there any need? We are so advanced in time, all our actions are
        obsolete. The nebula is collapsed, the issue is decided."</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "We do not know that. We are being pursued."</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> Aryz turned to the sensor wall—what was left of it—and saw that they were,
        indeed, being pursued. He had been lax.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "It is not your fault," the brood mind said. "You have been set a task that
        tainted you and ruined your function. You will dissipate."</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> Aryz hesitated. He had become so different, so tainted, that he actually
        hesitated at a direct command from the brood mind. But it was damaged. Without him, without what he had learned,
        what could it do? It wasn't reasoning correctly.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "There are facts you must know, important facts—"</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> Aryz felt a wave of revulsion, uncomprehending fear, and something not
        unlike human anger radiate from the brood mind. Whatever he had learned and however he had changed, he could not
        withstand that wave.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> Willingly, and yet against his will—it didn't matter—he felt himself
        liquefying. His pod slumped beneath him, and he fell over, landing on a pool of frozen ammonia. It burned, but
        he did not attempt to lift himself. Before he ended, he saw with surprising clarity what it was to be a branch
        ind, or a brood mind, or a human. Such a valuable insight, and it leaked out of his permea and froze on the
        ammonia.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> The brood mind regained what control it could of the fragment. But there
        were no defenses worthy of the name. Calm, preparing for its own dissipation, it waited for the pursuit to
        conclude.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> </span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> The Main set off an alarm. The interface with the mandate was severed. Weak,
        barely able to crawl, the humans looked at each other in horror and slid to opposite corners of the
        chamber.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> They were confused: Which of them was the captive, which the decoy shape? It
        didn't seem important. They were both bone-thin, filthy with their own excrement. They turned with one motion to
        stare at the bloated mutant. It sat in its corner, tiny head incongruous on the huge thorax, tiny arms and legs
        barely functional even when healthy. It smiled wanly at them.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "We felt you," one of the Prufraxes said. "You were with us in there." Her
        voice was a soft croak.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "That was my place," it replied. "My only place." "What function, what
        name?"</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> "I'm ... I know that. I'm a researcher. In there, I knew myself in
        there."</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> They squinted at the shape. The head. Something familiar, even now. "You're
        a Clevo ..."</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> There was noise all around them, cutting off the shape's weak words. As they
        watched, their chamber was sectioned like an orange, and the wedges peeled open. The illumination ceased. Cold
        enveloped them.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> A naked human female, surrounded by tiny versions of herself, like an angel
        circled by fairy kin, floated into the chamber. She was thin as a snake. She wore nothing but silver rings on
        her wrists and a thin torque around her waist. She glowed blue-green in the dark.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> The two Prufraxes moved their lips weakly but made no sound in the near
        vacuum. Who are you?</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> She surveyed them without expression, then held out her arms as if to fly.
        She wore no gloves, but she was of their type.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> As she had done countless times before on finding such Senexi
        experiments—though this seemed older than most—she lifted one arm higher. The blue-green intensified, spread in
        waves to the mangled walls, surrounded the freezing, dying shapes. Perfect, angelic, she left the debris behind
        to cast its fitful glow and fade.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> They destroyed every portion of the fragment but one. They left the mandate
        behind unharmed.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> Then they continued, millions of them thick like mist, working the spaces
        between the stars, their only master the overness of the real.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> They needed no other masters. They would never malfunction.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> </span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> The mandate drifted in the dark and cold, its memory going on, but its only
        life the rapidly fading tracks where minds had once passed through it. The trails writhed briefly, almost as if
        alive, but only following the quantum rules ofdiminished energy states. Briefly, a small memory was
        illuminated.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> Prufrax's last poem explained the mandate reflexively.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> </span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> How the fires grow! </span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> Peace passes</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> All memory lost.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> Somehow we always miss that single door, </span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> Dooming ourselves to circle.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> </span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> Ashes to stars, lies to souls,</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> Let's spin 'round the sinks and holes.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> Kill the good, eat the young. </span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> Forever and more </span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> You and I are never done.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> </span></p>

    <p class="calibre2"><span class="none"> The track faded into nothing. Around the mandate, the universe grew old very
        quickly.</span></p>
