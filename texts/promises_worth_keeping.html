    <h1>Promises Worth Keeping</h1>
    Harold Johnson, 1997

    <p>
      Intrinsic to colonial justice is the concept of punishment. This idea has
      roots in English history. The earliest written laws of England are
      contained in Aethelberht’s code. Aethelberht I of Kent was
      supposedly converted to Christianity by St. Augustine in about 600
      CE. Upon conversion, Aethelberht drafted a code wherein, instead of
      resorting to feuds to settle disputes, the parties had the option to
      settle for fixed sums of money. If one person killed another, the
      deceased’s kin, house, or church could demand a code-determined
      amount proportionate to the worth of the deceased. The Christian
      church encouraged this early alternative to the feud and private
      dispute settlement, not only because the church had a problem with
      people both fighting a feud and upholding Christian values, but also
      because it provided a windfall for the church. Aethelberht’s code
      demanded the highest payments for dead priests and actions against
      the church.

      The Christian concept of penance played a huge role in the
development of a concept of criminal law. A wrongdoer had to pay
penance to cover the sin of his crime. The shift was subtle but
evolutionary. The penance was, of course, paid not to the kin of the
victim but to the church. These rewards gained from processing
criminals soon led the church to establish its own courts. The concept
of a fine was well established in the ecclesiastical courts and in canon
law before the king took over those courts and claimed the proceeds
for himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Today, all fines are paid to the Crown. The victims and their families
are forgotten in the modern machinery of the criminal justice system.
The ideological constructs of the criminal justice system have
evolved slowly from penance to punishment, which continues to be
the major factor in sentencing principles. However, the dominant
underlying motivation remains economic.
    </p>

    <p>
      Whereas Aethelberht set in motion the economically motivated
evolution of state jurisdiction over the criminal, thereby taking
jurisdiction away from the community, later generations have
certainly perfected the system. With the development of capitalism,
criminal law underwent a major revolution. The factory and the
penitentiary are similar institutions. Each operates according to strict
rules of conduct and authority. Each operates under strict rules of
time. The factory processes materials, and the penitentiary processes
Indians.
    </p>
    <p>
      Economics dominates thought in this century. With the collapse of
the Soviet Socialist Union, cowboy capitalism has been left to
dominate the world agenda. There are no imagined alternatives. The
political right dominates, and the left, if not dead, is stalled. The
criminal justice system, like all other systems in the industrial world, is
affected by the move to the right. The only arguments that are
listened to when discussing the criminal justice system are economic:
“It costs x to keep an Indian in jail for a year.”
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      Treaties No. 6 and No. 7 hold a promise of Indian maintenance of
      “peace and good order.” That Indians “aid and assist the officers of
      Her Majesty in bringing to justice and punishment any Indian”
      requires the Indians to participate in the economics of the criminal
      justice system. If the Indians participate by aiding and assisting the
      officers of her Majesty, they undermine their ability to maintain peace
      and good order amongst themselves. When Indians who have been
      processed in the industrial penal institutions are released, they
      require community resources to return to a way of life where they can
      participate in peace and good order.
    </p>
    <p>
      The more the Indians aid and assist the criminal justice system, the
more they destroy their ability to maintain peace and good order. When the Indians reach a point where they are no longer able to
maintain peace and good order, they are completely wedded to
aiding and assisting the officers of Her Majesty in punishing. In order
to re-achieve peace and good order, the Indians must stop aiding and
assisting the officers of Her Majesty. The Indians must stop
participating in the economics of justice and punishment and focus
their limited resources on maintaining peace and good order.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peace and good order cannot compete with justice and
punishment in the economic arena. They are diametrically opposed
principles. Justice and punishment are the values of a hierarchy.
Ultimate peace and good order can be achieved only in an anarchy,
which exists without hierarchy of any kind. In a true anarchy, people
live together without oppression. The argument against anarchy, of
course, is that without authority, competing interests would cause
anarchy to deteriorate into chaos. Nevertheless, if anarchy could be
maintained, it would, until deterioration, be ultimate peace and good
order. By contrast, whenever hierarchy is imposed—whether through
benevolent democracy, despotic tyranny, or economic democracy—it
results in some form of oppression. According to hierarchical thinking,
oppression through the imposition of justice and punishment is
necessary to achieve a semblance of peace and good order.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet peace and good order cannot exist in an oppressive state. The
act of oppressing by imposing punishment destroys the peace. It is
not good order to use violence to maintain the appearance of order.
Punishment is violence. Incarceration is violence. The violence of
incarceration maintains and is maintained by the economic system of
the industrial capitalist criminal justice system.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are left with the problem of participating, aiding, and assisting
hierarchy in an attempt to re-create peace and good order. Yet the
criminal justice system’s use of violent punishment has decimated
our communities. Do we break our treaty promise to keep peace and
good order, or do we break our treaty promise to aid and assist? The
answer is, of course, economic. If we are denied the resources to
heal the incarcerated, we will not be able to maintain peace and good
order.
