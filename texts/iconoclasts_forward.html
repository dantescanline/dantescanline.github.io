    <h1>Iconoclasts, Forward!</h1>
    By Renzo Novatore, 1920
<p>
History, materialism, monism, positivism and all the other isms
of this world are old and rusty swords which are of no use to me and don't
concern me. My principle is life and my end is death. I want to live my life
intensely so that I can embrace my death tragically. You are waiting for
the revolution! Very well! My own began along time ago! When you are
ready - God, what an endless wait! - it won't nauseate me to go along the
road awhile with you! But when you stop, I will continue on my mad and
triumphant march toward the great and sublime conquest of Nothing!

</p>
<p>

    Every society you build will have its fringes, and on the fringes of
    every society, heroic and restless vagabonds will wander, with their wild
    and virgin thoughts, only able to live by preparing ever new and terrible
    outbreaks of rebellion! I shall be among them! And after me, as before
me, there will always be those who tell human beings: â€œSo turn to your-
selves rather than to your gods or idols: discover what is hidden within
you, bring it to the light; reveal yourself!
</p>
<p>
    Because everyone that searches his inner being and draws out
what is mysteriously hidden there, is a shadow eclipsing every form of
Society that exists beneath the rays of the Sun! All societies tremble when
the scornful aristocracy of Vagabonds, Unique ones, Unapproachable
ones, rulers over the ideal, and Conquerors of Nothing advance without
inhibitions. So, come on, Iconoclasts, forward! Already the foreboding
sky grows dark and silent!
